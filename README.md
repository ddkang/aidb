# AIDB

Analyze unstructured data blazingly fast with machine learning. Connect your own ML models to your own data sources and query away!


## Quick Start

### Text Example (in CSV)
Show an example of running on reviews or Tweets data

### Image Example (local directory)
Show an example of images in the local directory


## Key Features

AIDB focuses on keeping cost down and interoperability high.

We reduce costs with our optimizations:
- First-class support for approximate queries, reducing the cost of aggregations by up to **350x**.
- Caching, which speeds up multiple queries over the same data.

We keep interoperability high by allowing you to bring your own data source, ML models, and vector databases!


## Approximate Querying
Show an example of new keywords i.e. TARGET_ERROR and CONFIDENCE
