0,Health & Beauty,5,"Amazon's batteries are great. I've had no problems with them leaking or corroding. They last as long as any other AA battery I've used too.The AmazonBasics brand has been great for so many different things, and I definitely recommend these batteries."
1,Health & Beauty,5,always need batteries
2,Electronics,4,"It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good."
3,Electronics,4,I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
4,Electronics,4,"For the price, it is quite a nice tablet. I must admit there's little I've done with it for now, the goal being to get it to the kids to control their Lego Boost kit with it."
5,Electronics,4,This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
6,Electronics,4,This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
7,Health & Beauty,5,"Great deal, thanks"
8,Electronics,4,Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
9,Health & Beauty,5,These are a good buy.
10,Electronics,3,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
11,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
12,Electronics,4,I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
13,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Seems to be great but just need a little more time to play with it. The main user is nearly four years old. Happy with it and gets excited when using it.
14,Electronics,4,Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............
15,Health & Beauty,5,Fast delivery. Will order again
16,Health & Beauty,2,These leaked battery acid twice over a two week person in LED lights which don't pull a lot of power. I will go for a brand name next time...I can't have my students getting burns from leaky batteries.
17,Electronics,4,"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
18,Electronics,4,"If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem."
19,Health & Beauty,5,"Best Product Value , Amazon know what they doing (:Good price for quantity , for sure will buy more ."
20,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is a great little phone. It feels like a true moto phone. I like the pure experience of the software. While it's not on par with the $600+ phones... Dollar for dollar, it is well worth the cost. Definitely a good buy."
21,Health & Beauty,4,Excellent deal for 36 batteries. I have found the batteries do not last quite as long as Duracell or other brands. Not as noticeable in remotes or such but flashlights will drain them quickly. They are still an excellent deal though.
22,Electronics,4,Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
23,Electronics,4,Kids love it. Easy for them to use. Only issue is there is a ton of Ads that pop up.
24,Electronics,4,"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
25,Electronics,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
26,Health & Beauty,5,Good Batteries
27,Health & Beauty,1,"I had high hopes for these and very surprised at alt he high rating. I must have received a bad batch. This is a large qty and 6-8 months after purchase, using these batteries and they are no good. I figured they just wore out since i did not use them. Very disappointed and a good 20+ are trash. Real bummer."
28,Electronics,2,"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
29,Health & Beauty,4,"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk."
30,Electronics,4,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
31,Electronics,2,I think the charging port should be something more simple since this product is aimed at smaller children. We‚Äôve only had ours for a month and the port is broke. Getting a new one sent to us.
32,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
33,Electronics,4,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
34,Health & Beauty,5,Worked just fine for the price!
35,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality
36,Health & Beauty,5,good
37,Health & Beauty,5,can never have too many batteries on hand
38,Health & Beauty,4,Just what I needed.
39,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I have no issues with product. Daughter seems to love it
40,Electronics,4,Used it for watching television shows. The picture was clear and the audio was decent for the location of the speakers.
41,Electronics,4,My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
42,Health & Beauty,5,excellent
43,Electronics,4,Am happy with my purchase and the item is being used by my brother's son and he is also happy as on dat
44,Health & Beauty,5,"Throw away all my generic batteries and replaced with these. 48-Pack came in a nice carton box with 4-pcs. battery in each plastic wrap. Used in remote controllers, game controllers, mouse, automatic spray air fresheners, LED flashlights and camping lanterns, clocks, wall lamps, and other devices. Excellent batteries for the price."
45,Electronics,1,"The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!"
46,Health & Beauty,4,"they work well so far, cheaper than other batteries i have seen. hoping there wont be any leakage or anything."
47,Electronics,4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
48,Electronics,4,This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
49,Electronics,4,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
50,Health & Beauty,4,Good buy don't know how well they will last have to wait and see.
51,Electronics,4,Easy to use reading device. Looking forward to watching movies on it. Great value
52,Electronics,4,It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product
53,Electronics,4,"Nice sound for the money, good highs not much lows"
54,Electronics,4,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
55,Health & Beauty,5,Decent batteries
56,Health & Beauty,1,"I put two of these batteries in my wireless mouse and in less than two hours use, they had burned up. The mouse quit working and I went to check the batteries and they literally burned my fingers trying to get them out. I will throw the rest of them away and NEVER buy these again.I know I'll never get my money back. I'll just write it off as a lesson learned."
57,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries for the price
58,Electronics,4,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
59,Electronics,4,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
60,Health & Beauty,5,"These seem as good as top-tier brands and models.Using these on professional audio equipment... the equipment ran the same amount of time.I think the only difference, is they are vastly less expensive."
61,Electronics,4,Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
62,Health & Beauty,2,Not fresh. Run down fast.
63,Health & Beauty,5,Great
64,Electronics,4,"As abv, takes 3 + hours to fully charge. I hoped it would be much faster (maybe an hour), to the point that I had thought I got a lemon. People were kind enough to answer my question, and learned that I should not expect miracles, lol. Apart from that, good thing it comes with the cord, and is compact enough."
65,Health & Beauty,5,Simply great
66,Electronics,4,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
67,Health & Beauty,4,"These are good little batteries for the price. They come wrapped four to a shrink wrap pack, the rest of the box seems sturdy. I tested a few out of the box and they all show 1.5 volts as they should!"
68,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great tablet for destructive toddlers. My son has dropped and thrown it several times and it still works!...
69,Electronics,4,"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
70,Health & Beauty,3,"Meh, they work, wud gladly pay more for USA made tho!"
71,Health & Beauty,5,great stuff
72,Health & Beauty,5,good
73,Health & Beauty,5,thank you
74,Health & Beauty,5,AA batteries worked perfectly out of the box!
75,Electronics,4,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
76,Electronics,4,I like it because is very resistant . The only thing we didn't like is that sometimes it's kinda slow
77,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
78,Electronics,4,Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
79,Health & Beauty,4,"Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far."
80,Electronics,3,"This tablet overall is okay,there are few problems that i face with this tablet. Charging this tablet takes little longer than the average tabletSome of the application is not available through amazon store app"
81,Electronics,4,Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
82,Health & Beauty,5,Exactly what I needed at a great price.
83,Health & Beauty,1,Awful poor performance. My mouse ran for several weeks to several months from Duracells but have never gotten more that several days from these. Will not buy again.
84,Health & Beauty,1,"Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time"
85,Electronics,3,The tablet is for my son who is 2. That being said I noticed blotches on the screen. Never returned it due to it not making a difference to my son. I will have to upgrade him in question few years anyway. The bumper is amazing.
86,Health & Beauty,4,I'm sure they will meet my needs. Thanks.
87,Health & Beauty,2,Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference
88,Health & Beauty,5,"These work as well as any big name brand batteries. I'm a heavy pc user since I work from home and I use a wireless mouse with my laptop. I can get weeks of use out of these without an issue. And even when the low battery light starts flashing on the mouse, I still get 2-3 days use out of them. Save your money, and buy these instead."
89,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Good Quality. No complaints.
90,"Electronics,Media",4,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
91,Electronics,4,My daughter like the tablet and she use the tabet everday
92,Health & Beauty,5,"Good Batteries, but not as long lasting as the Duracell batteries."
93,Health & Beauty,4,good value.
94,Electronics,4,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
95,Health & Beauty,2,"Tried them in my amazon firestick remote and they failed to make the remote work. However, no batteries have made it work. Seems the Amazon firestick remote is the problem. In any event I am stuck with 8 batteries that I do not need."
96,Electronics,4,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
97,Health & Beauty,3,These didn't last very long.
98,Health & Beauty,5,These are batteries at a great price!
99,Health & Beauty,5,Great value.
100,Health & Beauty,5,no problems
101,Electronics,3,It's ok but I rather have bought Samsung Galaxy Tab
102,Electronics,4,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
103,Electronics,4,Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
104,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
105,Electronics,3,Bought this tablet for 8 year old. It holding up good & she loves it. She enjoys playimg her games & being able to get on the internet.
106,Electronics,3,"When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help."
107,Electronics,4,"If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account."
108,Health & Beauty,5,FOR THE PRICE....THEY ARE OK
109,Health & Beauty,4,"This is a great deal on bulk batteries, they seem to last a reasonable amount of time. They do not seem to last as long as the big name brands (this is based on how long between battery changes for my xbox one controller) .but for the savings it's well worth it."
110,Health & Beauty,1,these batteries are terrible very disappointed. i have purchased before great long lasting very powerful. i must have received a bad batch they don't last very long. i may not purchase again.
111,Electronics,4,This edition of the kindle fire is a great improvement over the last model I had. The battery life is much better and it charges faster. The only drawback I have experienced is that the operation is sometimes slow. But I attribute that to having a 200GB expansion chip.
112,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought one before for my son and now he's brother turned 2 years and I decided to get one for him. He enjoys his tablet and battery life is good and I installed the educational app he wanted.
113,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries started leaking right out of the box.I threw them in the trash and went back to Duracell.
114,Health & Beauty,5,works for the office
115,Health & Beauty,4,Great batteries for the price.
116,Health & Beauty,5,They work
117,Health & Beauty,1,I updated my credit car d more than six weeks ago. I won't bother you in the future.
118,Health & Beauty,1,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.
119,Health & Beauty,4,"They are batteries, so can't say I love them! But I've had good results with Amazon's AA's so trying these now."
120,Health & Beauty,4,You can't beat these batteries when it comes to price. My son has seemingly a million toys that require batteries and it's always handy to have some around when he leaves them on (thomas the train motorized engines). Buying these from Amazon saves me a lot of money vice buying them from a major retailer. Thanks Amazon!Pro: cheap and reliable
121,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal.
122,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good.
123,Health & Beauty,1,"These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order."
124,Health & Beauty,5,"So far so good, I'll try and let folks know if they don't last as long as branded batteries."
125,Electronics,4,"I didn't need a super expensive tablet, I just needed a basic one for couple different apps I needed. This one works perfect. Need a basic tablet for Netflix or Hulu or Amazon this works great. But don't expect it to be Ipad."
126,Health & Beauty,4,great buy
127,Electronics,2,Very difficult to connect to You Tube. Very frustrating
128,Electronics,4,The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
129,Electronics,4,"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
130,Electronics,4,Like that downloading books is fast. I am still learning features and have not explored other positives featured.
131,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
132,Health & Beauty,5,"3rd purchase of these AA from Amazon, all have expiration of 2027. Ones I've used thus far last as Long as name brands"
133,Health & Beauty,4,hope they last long
134,Electronics,4,Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
135,Electronics,4,We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
136,Electronics,4,Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
137,Health & Beauty,5,great
138,Health & Beauty,5,Product as advertised. Arrived on time and in good condition. Good value! Will buy again.
139,Health & Beauty,5,Just batteries what can I say.
140,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
141,Health & Beauty,1,Don't waste your money. They last about 2 days in a wii remote.
142,Electronics,4,"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
143,Health & Beauty,5,Good
144,Electronics,4,This is the second one I have Purchased. I purchased the 16 MB version for less than 50.00. As long as you understand it is an Amazon product it a darn good Tablet for the money
145,Health & Beauty,5,"WORKS AS WELL AS NAME BRAND BATTERIES, BUT COST A LOT LESS."
146,Electronics,3,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
147,Electronics,3,Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
148,Electronics,4,"Was super easy to connect via Bluetooth - great sound, fun to use."
149,Electronics,1,"I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."
150,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
151,Electronics,4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
152,Health & Beauty,3,"They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me. If they melt a remote control or something, I'll try to remember to come back and letchall know."
153,Health & Beauty,5,Super!
154,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries give you power!
155,Health & Beauty,5,Came in quickly and just what I needed.
156,Health & Beauty,5,Better than expected. Good quality and good price. Fast shipping.
157,Electronics,4,Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money
158,Health & Beauty,5,great product just as described
159,Electronics,4,The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
160,Health & Beauty,4,Great batteries! I have nothing negative I can say about this product. They work just as well as any name brand product you would buy off the shelf at any store except these are probably one quarter of the price.
161,Health & Beauty,3,"They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair."
162,Health & Beauty,3,Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.
163,Health & Beauty,5,Good quality
164,Health & Beauty,5,Good cheap batteries
165,"Electronics,Media",4,The Oasis has a very sleek design that is very comfortable in hand. The flat transition from screen to bezel is very attractive. Backlight is great and its nice to be able to have it adjust automatically or manually. Menus are easy to access an understand. Wifi works great. The print looks very nice and easy easy on the eyes. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is due to the relatively high price.
166,Electronics,4,"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
167,Health & Beauty,3,ok for the price
168,Health & Beauty,5,as expected
169,Health & Beauty,3,Do not last as long as costco/kirkland equivalents.
170,Health & Beauty,5,"They are fine as far as I can tell. (These are probably a private label version of a major brand.) I am counting on the Amazon brand in assuming they are identical to batteries from other brands. Good price, of course. The 5 stars really reflect my trust of Amazon."
171,Health & Beauty,4,the batteries were fine.
172,Health & Beauty,1,Inconsistent. VERY short life.
173,Health & Beauty,5,good value for price
174,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries. Significantly more cost effective than Duracel Energizer. Rated 4* because I can't yet say how they last compared to the two big brands but so far they're performing well.
175,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries seem to last a good amount of time and I received all of them in this pack unlike the AAA pack I bought from Amazon which was missing four batteries.
176,Electronics,4,"It is a tablet. Downloads kids apps fast. Only complaint is when I shut it down the kid's user screen goes away. I do pull it back up but both my child and I get annoyed. Some regular apps I have not been able to remove from the regular screen. However, I would recommend."
177,Health & Beauty,5,What a massive batch of batteries! This beats prices even the big box stores have.
178,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are a great value.
179,Electronics,4,Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
180,Electronics,1,"I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible."
181,Electronics,4,"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
182,Health & Beauty,4,They are batteries and as such work just as expected.
183,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries.
184,Electronics,3,When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't
185,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
186,Health & Beauty,4,Shipped fast and so far lasting like other major brand batteries.
187,Health & Beauty,4,Good as any other alkaline cell. Price is good
188,Health & Beauty,5,A lot of batteries for a good price! Came on time!
189,Electronics,4,"Got this for my mom, so she could check facebook without getting on her computer. So far, no problems, even tho she's not tech savvy."
190,Electronics,4,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."
191,Electronics,4,Purchased as a a present. Girlfriend loves it. Would suggest buying for yourself or a loved one
192,Health & Beauty,5,"1,63 volts"
193,Electronics,4,"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
194,Health & Beauty,3,decent batteries. ok life.
195,Electronics,4,This is a nice and inexpensive tablet. Great for reading on or looking up info on the Internet. Only downfall is you can't download some online games onto it.
196,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent value. Last as long as brand name batteries at a fraction of brand price.
197,Health & Beauty,5,They just work as any other batteries
198,Electronics,3,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better
199,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries won't last long. An led flashlight will drain them in a hurry. I usually like Amazon products but this is one to avoid.
200,Electronics,4,"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
201,Health & Beauty,3,I feel like they don't work as long.
202,Electronics,1,Its very cool great picture good sound. Was kind of disappointed that i couldnt make calls but overall great piece of hardwark
203,Health & Beauty,5,"as advertised, we used them for care packages we pass out to the homeless."
204,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent products.
205,Health & Beauty,5,"Had good luck with these, especially for price."
206,Health & Beauty,5,good price and quality
207,Health & Beauty,1,"mu AA Amazon batteries made in Indonesia were without power after 12 months, bought in May 2016"
208,Health & Beauty,5,wonderful battery multi pack
209,Electronics,4,"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
210,Electronics,4,"Tablet is great, battery satisfactory. Case works great, within 10 minutes of opening the tablet, my grandson dropped it. No damage!!Easy to use. Highly recommend."
211,Electronics,4,Wall charger is convenient. Just wish it was sold with the kindle instead of having to purchase it separate. Seems like it should be standard in the package. Had to purchase in a bundle in order to get it included with kindle.
212,Electronics,4,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
213,Health & Beauty,5,"long lasting and powerful. also, best pricing."
214,Health & Beauty,5,"I like to have a good stock of batteries in my home. I am a repeat purchaser of these and other sizes. So far no performance issues. Lasts like Duracell. They might consider improving the graphics though, not very exciting to look at."
215,Health & Beauty,1,Might as well be dead on arrival. Already burned through two sets of 4 of these since I ordered them less than two months ago on a Schlage keypad deadbolt lock. The previous batteries lasted over a year. I'll never order another Amazon basics battery.
216,Health & Beauty,5,A good grade of battery. Enough that Christmas was OK. Thumbs up!
217,Health & Beauty,5,No reason to buy more expensive batteries.
218,Electronics,4,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
219,Health & Beauty,2,Many batteries do not have full capacity. I read each with a meter before using. Often find one at .8 volt or below. I won't buy again.
220,Electronics,3,"This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone."
221,Electronics,3,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
222,Electronics,4,"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page."
223,Health & Beauty,4,AA! Would buy again!
224,Health & Beauty,3,"They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them. In my Xbox controller they lasted an adequate amount of time. So all in all these definitely aren't for heavy use and the price point reflects that."
225,Health & Beauty,4,"I have yet to be disappointed by an Amazon Basics product, to me a battery is a battery it's the cost I look at. These were the lowest cost per battery on the site."
226,Electronics,3,"Easy to use but more limited than a more powerful tablet such as a Galaxy or iPad. Video conferencing is rather difficult to do in my experience. However if you read digital books, watch videos, or listen to music it works well and the stereo sound with the larger versions is really nice."
227,Electronics,4,My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.
228,Electronics,4,"I am the purchaser, not the user, but have owned a Kindle myself. These products are very reliable & easy to use."
229,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
230,Health & Beauty,5,Great
231,Electronics,4,My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
232,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon Basics - you are my hero. These are great batteries. I use them in my Apple keyboard and mouse and they have outlasted the brandname batteries I used to use. I get on average an additional 1-2 weeks of use out of each set of batteries which is an additional money saver. The shelf life seems to be normal for alkaline batteries.The packaging is biodegradable which adds to the convenience and value.
233,Health & Beauty,5,A battery is a battery these work just as good if not better than the name brands like Duracell or Enginzer
234,Electronics,4,"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
235,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
236,Electronics,4,"I use it mostly to watch videos, movies on it on the go. I have an iPad Pro 12.9 inch and I love it but I‚Äôm always nervous about dropping it. The kindle fire is great because it‚Äôs so durable"
237,Health & Beauty,5,Power
238,Health & Beauty,5,"For the price, unbeatable."
239,Electronics,4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
240,Health & Beauty,4,I like it
241,Electronics,4,Bought it for my pre-k daughter but my teen-ager daughter took it for a try and she so love it!
242,Electronics,4,nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
243,Electronics,4,This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
244,Health & Beauty,5,Good price hope they have good product life!
245,Electronics,4,Bought this as a gift.. Good price and features for this Kindle
246,Health & Beauty,3,"Decent battery, but seem to change them out a little bit faster than the big name batteries."
247,Health & Beauty,5,Best battery buy. So much cheaper and they work just as well.
248,Health & Beauty,5,good price
249,Health & Beauty,1,"I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use."
250,Health & Beauty,4,Good value!
251,Electronics,4,Great picture compared to my last kindle and love the camera option
252,Electronics,3,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
253,Electronics,4,The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.
254,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for toddlers, price is very affordable and it design gets a feeling of unbreakable hard tablet."
255,Health & Beauty,5,"a great deal, in time for hurricane matthew"
256,Health & Beauty,5,as good maybe in some cases better than the bunny batteries.
257,Electronics,4,"Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet."
258,"Electronics,Media",4,"I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues."
259,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
260,Health & Beauty,2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
261,"Electronics,Media",4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
262,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet for my son. Great price and has great features. Camera quality is not good
263,Electronics,2,"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
264,Electronics,4,I purchased this for raffle prizes and they're great for the price.
265,Electronics,4,"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
266,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"The Kindle 8 is an inexpensive eReader that does what I need in the smallest, thinnest, lightest package. I want it for travel and portable convenience when a full-size tablet is too big and heavy. It's perfect."
267,Electronics,1,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
268,Health & Beauty,5,Can you make bad batteries in 2017
269,Electronics,4,I was expecting better battery life cause they claim 6weeks of battery life. I am getting 3weeks. I wish it was little better than that. But that's my only issue
270,Health & Beauty,5,I tested the lifespan of these batteries with my Wireless mouse. Lasts just as long as Duracell CopperTop AAA.
271,Health & Beauty,5,These are great batteries and they are real light on the pocket book compared to other National brands!
272,Electronics,4,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
273,Health & Beauty,4,No complaints. Works just as good and lasts just as long as the name brands. They will give a pink bunny a run for his money.
274,Health & Beauty,4,"Still evaluating, but just bought some more because they work well with my applications and their price is the best."
275,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I don't encourage a lot of TV watching so the Amozon Fire was a good substitute. It's great for travel. My granddaughter plays games as she learns. Good preparation tablet for introducing her to her next tablet in a few months. Using this one to teach responsibility as she learns.
276,Health & Beauty,2,A Great Price but not a great battery. They just don't last as long as the brand names.
277,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
278,Electronics,3,"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
279,Health & Beauty,5,This is an affordable set of rechargable Alkaline batteries.
280,Health & Beauty,5,Good battery for money
281,Electronics,4,Bought this for my 75 year old mother and she loves it. Easy to read.
282,Health & Beauty,4,Good value and performance for the price.
283,Health & Beauty,1,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
284,Health & Beauty,4,Junk.
285,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.
286,Electronics,4,I like the speed and layout. Not a lot of options with the apps. But so far okay.
287,Electronics,4,I bought one last year for one cousin and had to continue for another this year. Great buy imo.
288,Electronics,4,"I have several echo dots around my home, but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn't have one and control things around the house, listen to the news or music. It holds a great charge."
289,Health & Beauty,5,"Great Product, Great Price, Amazon Rocks!!!"
290,Electronics,4,"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
291,Health & Beauty,5,Just as advertised
292,Health & Beauty,4,Good price. They works.
293,Health & Beauty,5,just what I needed
294,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries died after a week. Same appliance used Duracell batteries for half a year.
295,Health & Beauty,5,good value
296,Health & Beauty,3,I think it was recargable
297,Health & Beauty,4,Good
298,Health & Beauty,5,This is a great value!
299,Electronics,4,Moved all the ad apps to a folder and loaded what I wanted. Small size fits in my sport coat pocket.
300,Health & Beauty,5,Came in handy for the fire tv stick
301,Electronics,4,"I gave this Amazon charger only four stars, because even though it does a great job of charging my new Paperwhite quickly it should be included with the reader and not sold separately."
302,Electronics,4,Is great value for the price. Quality is good. I like that is not heavy.
303,Health & Beauty,1,I need batteries that register 1.5V out of the box my camera flash remotes depend on it! NONE of the batteries I tested were more than 1.3V fresh out of the box. Unacceptable! Spend a few more bucks and get some decent name brand batteries. These are pathetic. Anyone need a 20-pack of 1.3V batteries
304,Health & Beauty,1,very cheap batteries
305,Health & Beauty,1,"Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good."
306,Health & Beauty,5,Great Value. I'm sure Anazon doesn't have a battery company.
307,Electronics,4,Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
308,Electronics,1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
309,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
310,Health & Beauty,5,They work
311,Health & Beauty,5,"good product, good price"
312,Electronics,2,fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
313,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,kid proof! bought for my grand babies and they love it!
314,Electronics,4,"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
315,Health & Beauty,5,Very affordable.
316,Electronics,4,"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay."
317,Electronics,4,I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
318,Health & Beauty,4,These are working very well for us and they are economical to use-which we do a lot of.
319,Health & Beauty,5,Good price for good batteries.
320,Electronics,4,I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
321,Electronics,4,limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
322,Electronics,4,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
323,Electronics,4,my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
324,Electronics,4,Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
325,Health & Beauty,5,All good
326,Health & Beauty,5,I happen to have remote controls in our house and this item certainly is a must in my living room.
327,Electronics,4,I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
328,Health & Beauty,3,They're AAA batteries
329,Health & Beauty,5,Great product!
330,Health & Beauty,4,Good
331,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Tablet works pretty good. I purchased it since I was a to make two accounts. One for myself and one for my child. Goo buy!!
332,Health & Beauty,5,excellent
333,Health & Beauty,4,C'mon it's batteries they work they were a good price
334,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
335,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it! Very easy to use and setup.
336,Electronics,3,I would would not recommend this for a child. It's not kid friendly at all. I have purchased 4 of them for my grandson and nephews and 3 was was damaged within a couple months. I think this product is is a better fit for adults.
337,Health & Beauty,3,Inexpensive but doesn't last long.
338,Health & Beauty,4,Difficult to be excited about AA batteries but everything about the purchase was as advertised. They were well packaged and even arrived several days early. They are working well. My regret is that I did not order AAA batteries at the same time.
339,Electronics,4,This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
340,Electronics,4,"Purchased for my sister, tablet novice.Easy setup, good screen brightness. Good for Internet browsing. Good beginner tablet"
341,Health & Beauty,4,These are a great price but they don't last as long as Energizer or Duracell.
342,Health & Beauty,5,ok
343,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle."
344,Health & Beauty,5,Good.
345,Electronics,4,Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
346,Electronics,4,I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.
347,Health & Beauty,4,Good Batteries.
348,Electronics,4,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
349,Health & Beauty,5,Good
350,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 5 year old grandson really enjoys his new tablet. He's had it for several months. The only negative I see is the charge port is starting to get loose. The small plug is maybe not robust enough for a 5 year old.
351,Electronics,4,it is worth the money. best bang for buck you cant go wrong with it
352,Health & Beauty,5,they work and they were inexpensive.
353,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, and great endurance."
354,Health & Beauty,3,The don't last as long as I'd hoped.
355,Electronics,4,We got this for our three year old daughter. At first she was not interested it it at all she just wanted my tablet but once she got use to it she now prefers it to my iPad
356,Health & Beauty,4,You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
357,Electronics,4,My little one loves all free apps.Shes quiet on long car rides when she brings along Fire table.
358,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries
359,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.
360,Health & Beauty,1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
361,Electronics,4,The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable
362,Health & Beauty,5,Something as simple as a pack of batteries brought to you by Amazon at a more than competitive price delivered to your door. How could you go wrong
363,Electronics,4,A good product that provides the services I desire.
364,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!
365,Electronics,4,"Using it in the kitchen mainly. It has good sound, works excellent as a cooking timer. Also alarm for certain events thruout the day. Nice music source."
366,Electronics,4,"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
367,Electronics,3,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
368,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I purchased this as a replacement for my older Kindle. It is excellent as always but I also noticed very little new features or updates since my last Kindle model. Would have liked some more design, form factor, or feature changes. That being said, it fits the bill and is amazingly light, so I have no other complaints."
369,Electronics,2,"I have always bought nabi's they have lasted for a couple of years with my grandkids This item I bought for my six year old grandson as an upgrade (his nabi lasted 26 months) This broke in two days after giving it to him, It would not charge and the LCD went out . I am now having to jump through hoops to get it replaced ."
370,Electronics,4,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
371,Health & Beauty,5,"Perfect battery, we trust the choice of Amazon basics."
372,Health & Beauty,5,Good Deal
373,Health & Beauty,5,"Cant beat the price, and these batteries seem to last forever even with heavy use. I grabbed this multi pack because you never know when you'll need AAA's and they've come in handy."
374,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries.
375,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, good shelf life."
376,Electronics,4,Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
377,Health & Beauty,5,Pretty amazing ...
378,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever. I bought these and put them in the drawer till needed. I have thrown out every single one trying to find 3 that work.
379,Electronics,4,I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
380,Electronics,4,Great purchase for the $$$. Does what I use it for.
381,Health & Beauty,3,Use them on my outdoor solar lights. They lasted 2 weeks and they stopped working.
382,Electronics,4,I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
383,Electronics,4,We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
384,Health & Beauty,5,I had no clue Amazon basics did batteries- great price. Never buying from big box stores again!
385,Health & Beauty,1,Broke about a month after ordering them.
386,Health & Beauty,5,Price was right!
387,Electronics,4,amazing tablet for kids and also adults can switch out between kid accounts and also adult account
388,Health & Beauty,3,"Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load."
389,Health & Beauty,4,Decent batteries price wise but don't seem to last as long as the name brand batteries and I assume these are actually some lower end name brand batteries that Amazon has their name stuck on them.
390,Health & Beauty,5,They work
391,Electronics,4,"Decent tablet, bought as a gift. My niece was very happy"
392,Health & Beauty,1,"These are wretched batteries. They typically last only two weeks in a TV remote control device, they can't power a computer's mouse beyond a week, and I have serious doubts about their shelf life. Packaging is nice, though, sort of like The Washington Post."
393,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
394,Health & Beauty,1,batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed
395,Electronics,4,I love this kindle. Faster than the paper white in how it responds to changing pages and/or books. The self adjusting light levels works very good in mine. Having the option on the frame to change pages is great but you have to press a little hard on the forward page button or it will do a backward change instead
396,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Durable and great tablet to handle and navigate. Camera quality is good to be used by a 2 year old. Great children features
397,Health & Beauty,5,Good product
398,Health & Beauty,3,I like how i got so many itd months later and i still got a pack left!!
399,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries, great price.minor side note- batteries are actually silver, not white as they look in the picture"
400,Health & Beauty,1,These are terrible. Don't last Put then in various items and their life is only 1/2 half of a Duracell
401,Electronics,3,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
402,Health & Beauty,4,"I still have not found an alkaline battery that outlasts a Duracell, but for the price, these are hard to beat. They've managed quite well in both an LED lamp and a wireless computer mouse. I'll be purchasing them again, for sure."
403,Electronics,4,"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
404,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
405,Health & Beauty,5,No problems
406,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries!
407,Electronics,4,Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
408,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"This is the perfect reader. Price is great, it's easy on your eyes. Battery lasts longer than a tablet."
409,Health & Beauty,4,like the convent package will see how long these last
410,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and they seem to last as long as name brands.
411,Electronics,4,"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
412,Electronics,4,"I've purchased 5 of these for my kids the last few years. While they are playing a tablet or two, I keep the other tablets charged. I've enjoyed using them myself."
413,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
414,Health & Beauty,5,"Same batteries for a cheaper price, yes please!"
415,Electronics,3,This is an older tablet. I probobly expected too much. If I'm going to deal with lagginess I prefer my ipad2.
416,Health & Beauty,2,"I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries."
417,Health & Beauty,1,"We must have gotten a defective lot, because these have caused every fire alarm in the house to sound within days of installing these batteries. Too late to return. So much for 10 year shelf life."
418,Health & Beauty,5,I am never buying brand name batteries again.
419,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
420,Electronics,4,My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
421,Electronics,3,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
422,Health & Beauty,5,Decided to try these private labeled batteries and they work excellently. I have already purchased more of a different size.
423,Health & Beauty,3,does not last too long
424,Electronics,4,The Amazon Fire is great for our 6 year old to play some games.
425,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
426,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My children loved it, and it is great learning tool."
427,Electronics,2,Not reaching my expectations and it's okay to kids to play games
428,Health & Beauty,4,"Great deal, no problems, with the purchase."
429,Health & Beauty,4,"good product, works as expected"
430,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
431,Health & Beauty,5,The price is fantastic and they work just as well as certain name brand batteries with the copper top and the bunny.
432,Health & Beauty,3,"I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on."
433,Health & Beauty,5,"good batteries, good value"
434,Electronics,4,"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
435,Health & Beauty,5,Great
436,Health & Beauty,1,"I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss."
437,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries for the price.
438,Electronics,2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
439,Electronics,4,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
440,Electronics,4,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
441,Health & Beauty,5,Work great for much less money than namebrand!
442,Health & Beauty,4,Right price
443,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Bought this for my four year old nephew and he loves it! He has dropped it several times, because of the hard shell case nothing happened. He is able to manipulate all educational games and has no problem with any operations."
444,Health & Beauty,5,as expected
445,Electronics,4,"I liked the volume buttons on the side of my old 7"" Fire better than on top like this new 8"". That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating."
446,Electronics,4,"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
447,Health & Beauty,5,"Worked great, just as good as any other name brand."
448,Health & Beauty,4,they seem to be okay just as good as what I usually buy only less expensive
449,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries
450,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries don't last as long as the top brands, but for the price I can't complain too much."
451,Electronics,4,"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
452,Health & Beauty,5,Cant beat the Subscribe and Save!
453,Electronics,4,Purchased this for my son. Has room to upgrade memory to allow more books & games. But the speakers could be better or located in a better position.
454,Health & Beauty,3,Medium durability. Gonna buy Duracell in future. Do you have great quality rechargeables
455,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries are fine. They are energetically active and power things up like I like.
456,Health & Beauty,5,very good itemfast shipmenthigh quality
457,Health & Beauty,4,power!
458,Health & Beauty,5,great value
459,Health & Beauty,5,A lot of batteries for a great price. Seriously couldn't pas this up.
460,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
461,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my aunt for Christmas. She had wanted a book reader. But then she decided she wanted something she could ""play games on."" She's very happy with it!"
462,Electronics,4,Pretty happy with this so far. Like the fact that you can add memory.
463,Health & Beauty,5,Great set of batteries for the price. So far I've gotten decent usage out of them.
464,Health & Beauty,5,Does the job!
465,Electronics,4,"ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE SCREEN IS SMALL, IT'S A GREAT LITTLE DEVICE. FOR THOSE THAT PREFER A LARGER SCREEN, THE ECHO SHOW WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE."
466,Health & Beauty,1,"These are absolute junk. I'm half way through the pack and so far every single battery has leaked.UPDATE:Ok, these batteries are horrible. Every single battery leaked, ruining some of the items they were in. In almost 30 years of buying from Amazon these batteries are the most disappointing thing thing I've ever received.Amazon, in case you are interested the lot number is JK150601"
467,Electronics,4,Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
468,Electronics,4,"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
469,Health & Beauty,5,Works just as good as the name brand batteries.
470,Electronics,4,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
471,Health & Beauty,1,"What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!"
472,Health & Beauty,5,work.
473,Electronics,4,Works great. Perfect for the age a lot of apps to download
474,Electronics,4,If your looking for a great tablet without the high price this is the tablet for you...
475,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries do not last long.
476,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
477,Electronics,4,I like how it works and it size very compact perfect for travel
478,Electronics,4,"Is a gift for Christmas, therefore not yet in use."
479,Health & Beauty,5,"I love the box they come in, I also love that they are amazon brand."
480,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen."
481,Health & Beauty,5,Work as described
482,Electronics,4,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
483,Health & Beauty,5,"Work well, last as long as name brand batteries."
484,Health & Beauty,5,Great value !
485,Health & Beauty,4,Good value!
486,Health & Beauty,4,Good deal
487,Electronics,4,Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
488,Health & Beauty,3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
489,Electronics,4,While it isn't the most powerful tablet on the market it does what it was designed to do. It gets on the social media sites and the internet. If you're expecting more from yoru tablet then don't look for one at this price. You'll need the more powerful ones that translate to bigger price tags. I've watched movies on this from my Amazon prime account and have read my books from my Kindle account and everything works well. It's not at lightening speed but it does get there in a timely manner!
490,Electronics,1,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
491,Electronics,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
492,Health & Beauty,1,Awful batteries don't work
493,Health & Beauty,5,Just what I needed
494,Electronics,4,"I have not had such a reliable speaker before. It is so easy to charge, and so easy to start playing songs right away. With Alexa, you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and pulling up Google.com. Love it."
495,Health & Beauty,2,they seem to wear out really fast
496,Health & Beauty,5,great
497,Health & Beauty,4,4 stars coz the batteries are in silver. Not white as shown in picture.
498,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
499,Health & Beauty,4,good value for the amount of batteries
500,Health & Beauty,5,great price
501,Health & Beauty,3,Doesn't seem to last as long in some devices as other brands but good for the cost.
502,Health & Beauty,4,They are batteries
503,Health & Beauty,5,Yes It is as ecpected
504,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries ok ok , but a fan of their packaging."
505,Health & Beauty,1,"Great price but they don't hold their charge for long. I find myself swapping out the remote batteries twice a year. At this price, it's not so bad but it's much more frequently that I'm used to."
506,Health & Beauty,5,Greaatttt deal. This probably the only way I'll be buying batteries at a good price too.
507,Electronics,4,I do like the portability of my Tap. You do lose some features from the Echo - like speaking to it from across the room. But i'm happy with it and it has good sound. great to take out by the pool!
508,Electronics,2,The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
509,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Gives a good quality, being that it's a poloroid camera"
510,Health & Beauty,5,These work great so far.
511,Electronics,4,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
512,Health & Beauty,5,Exactly as described. I'll learn if they last or not.
513,Health & Beauty,5,good
514,Health & Beauty,3,Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.
515,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent batteries and it's a better value than buying the batteries in smaller packs. Amazon's batteries are just as good as other manufacturers. With the subscribe and save, it's even a better deal."
516,Electronics,1,Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
517,Electronics,3,I bought this for 3 year old to replace an older Ipad. it was functional but no where near level of ipad. This is understandable based on price difference/ I returned to store.
518,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
519,Health & Beauty,5,Really useful now i have batteries for a long time
520,Health & Beauty,4,"It's hard to love a battery. All I can say is they work, and they seem to last as long as any others. The price is good, so I'm happy."
521,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality batteries. For this many batteries you'd have to pay twice this price if it was name brand. This is a no brainer.
522,Health & Beauty,5,Great product with quick delivery.
523,Health & Beauty,5,good product
524,Electronics,4,Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
525,Health & Beauty,5,No complaints and they get the job done. Fast shipping!
526,Health & Beauty,5,great value!
527,Health & Beauty,4,good buy
528,Electronics,4,I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
529,Electronics,4,Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
530,Electronics,4,Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
531,Health & Beauty,1,"3/4 of the package have been duds. Lasted about 15 minutes. Now I get to go to the trouble to return them. When you shop with Amazon, it's to save time. This defeats that purpose."
532,Electronics,4,I bought it for my grandson‚Äôs birthday... he loves it
533,Electronics,4,While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
534,Health & Beauty,5,They work.
535,Electronics,4,"Good product for what we needed it for. It keeps my little man busy when we're in the vehicle. Bad thing is, you'll have to pre-download items for them to play on the go, or just add your own movies for the long rides."
536,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"I received an email asking if I would like to give my review and I am glad that I did. I purchased this less than 2 months ago and it has already quit working. It will not charge and it will no longer power on. All I have is a black screen. When it did work, it dropped internet quite frequently and froze several times during use. I would not recommend this product."
537,Health & Beauty,5,use lots of the Amazon Basics batteries and they seem to work as well as more expensive brands
538,Health & Beauty,1,They don't seem to last that long as the ones you can get off the store. I bought them because I thought they were cheaper but Sam's club sells them cheaper and they last much longer.Update 1/10/2017Not only do they not last long but the new batteries that say are good till 11/2018 are pretty much dead without any use.Highly disappointed in amazon for this.
539,Electronics,4,Enjoyed the Kindle 7 and now this better version as well.
540,Electronics,4,I was impressed with the voyage overall. I especially like the light sensor feature because it makes reading enjoyable in all settings.
541,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive"
542,Health & Beauty,1,They do not work. I had to buy Duracell
543,Health & Beauty,4,"Got these mainly for use in Xbox one controllers. They don't last quite as long as energizer lithium (I'd say maybe 75 as long) but for the quantity and price, its a good deal. Will continue to use."
544,Health & Beauty,3,I miss the bunny with the drum.
545,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I have a few issues with this tablet. Mainly the fact that I can't get Google services on it, not even YouTube. Aside from that, the biggest downfall is the charging. The port is very loose and comes undone easily and the charge doesn't hold for very long."
546,Health & Beauty,3,Seems to be a good product. not sure they have a very long life.
547,Electronics,4,This tablet does everything it said it would. Works great.
548,Health & Beauty,5,great price fast shipping
549,Electronics,4,"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
550,Electronics,4,"I love everything about it.... it is portable, sounds better than most portable speakers, and Alexa rocks it. Only thing that kept it from a 5 star rating is that you have to manually activate Alexa. Wish it would work like the Echo and Dot, while it is on its base."
551,Health & Beauty,5,Loved the price of it.Worked great..
552,Electronics,4,I prefer spending the extra $70 or $80 to get the echo
553,Electronics,4,For a cheap starter tablet it's fine. Bought it to replace a cheaper kids tablet and it'll do for that.
554,Health & Beauty,1,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again."
555,Electronics,4,This tablet has far exceeded my expectations. The price was way lower than most other tablets but it does everything I need and want.
556,Health & Beauty,5,Getting these from now on.
557,Electronics,4,About this for my grand kids for Christmas they absolutely love it
558,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
559,Electronics,3,Overall this is a great product. It sometimes freezes with some of the games but other apps work great. Alexa is a great addition.
560,Electronics,4,"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
561,Electronics,2,The wifi would drop often to where I could not listen to Spotify or other services without buffering.
562,Health & Beauty,5,is good
563,Electronics,4,"To begin with this is the best reader available right now. Brighter than the pw2. Just awesome. Whether or not its a worthwhile upgrade from the paperwhite is another topic. Either way, it's a great piece of hardware- light, good grip, light etc. there is one HUGE issue however! The background light is not uniform- it is tinged yellow towards the top and blue towards the bottom of the device. For a $200 device thats unacceptable! How much that bothers u will be subjective and u wont notice it as much once u get into your book. The problem was present on all 3 devices I purchased (and returned), to the exact same degree. I kept the last one because it still is an awesome reader and it seems like its a production issue. Going through amazon reviews, various online forums- it seems to be present on a large number of devices if not all. Amazon refuses to address the issue, probably because they'll get sued or something for releasing a wonky product, like the iphone antenna problem bottom line- great device, but you have a high risk of receiving a unit with the gradient issue (youtube it if u cant visualize what I'm talking about, tons of videos out there describing it) . How bad it is seems to depend on your personal luck, or which batch your local bestbuy has stock from, and most importantly it will bother you / what youre willing to settle for. In my case, i hated it but there was no alternative- the pw2 seemed like a huge downgrade in a head to head comparison so i decided to keep my voyage and live with it. If thats a problem for you, wait for the 2015 edition. The pw1 had this issue apparently and it was addressed quietly by amazon in the pw2."
564,Health & Beauty,5,Work Fine... Will buy again
565,Health & Beauty,5,These seem to be fresher and last longer then the name brands.
566,Electronics,4,"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
567,Health & Beauty,1,"From experience, the worst batteries I've ever purchased. Not sure if these were manufactured second hand but more than half of the pack died within ONE USE. As a new mom who depends on the quality and longevity of a good battery for her child's needs, I will never order this product ever again."
568,Health & Beauty,3,not much better than the dollar store brand
569,Electronics,4,"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
570,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect!
571,Electronics,4,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
572,Electronics,4,Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
573,Electronics,4,"If you're a Amazon frequent flyer like me, HD fire is very fun and convenient placing all aspects of Amazon at your finger tips. The only thing i dont like about it is that its slow like most tablets."
574,Electronics,4,Awesome. I really enjoy using it. The portability is a plus!
575,Electronics,4,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
576,Health & Beauty,5,Work great. Never found a dead one in the batch. Will definitely purchase again.
577,Health & Beauty,1,"These run down in my TV remote quicker than any battery I have used. TV says low battery within a week of installing. I will try another brand next time. Amazon, please keep an eye on quality and have your manufacturer test and give you results periodically. They will often provide good samples for evaluation early in production and then lower quality later."
578,Health & Beauty,1,"I was super bummed about these! I purchased them exactly 3 months ago today. I only used 8 batteries when they arrived, and they have all started to die this week already. When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users."
579,Health & Beauty,2,Some batteries worked okay. I just had a problem where a new battery worked for a week and then there was no charge. Not worth the price.
580,Electronics,4,"I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
581,Electronics,3,"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store."
582,Electronics,4,This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
583,Electronics,4,He is a wizard with computers and tablets and knows much more than me.
584,Health & Beauty,5,This was my second purchase of amazon batteries and they work great. Just as good or even better than name brand batteries and half the price. This will be the only way I purchase batteries from now on!
585,Health & Beauty,5,It's a battery. It works.
586,Electronics,3,Great purchase for a 9-year old girl. Easy way for peaceful long car rides.
587,Electronics,4,"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
588,Electronics,4,The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
589,Health & Beauty,5,Works as described.
590,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD PRODUCT!
591,Health & Beauty,5,these seem fine only time will tell
592,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
593,Electronics,4,It's a great tablet for a destructive 10 year old. It's still going strong for 2 months now
594,Health & Beauty,5,good
595,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
596,Health & Beauty,5,"With some reservations these appear to be excellent batteries. I replaced some Duracell batteries in several LED flashlights with these and the light was much brighter with Amazon batteries (side by side testing, two identical flashlights). I am impressed. On the down side, the date (I supposed expiration date of shelf life) is almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. It is very readable on Duracell batteries. These were 2025 dated, so obviously they are 10 years out, and that's very good, will surely use them up long before then. The packaging is simple, but more or less necessitates a container to store them as they will just fall all over the drawer once opened. In hard to read print on the batteries it says made in Indonesia. Not Japan as some reviews had thought might be the country of origin. BTW -- the Duracells AAA's I removed from my flashlight leaked badly and ruined the (expensive) flashlight. Therefore I am sticking with Amazon batteries for now."
597,Electronics,4,I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
598,Electronics,2,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
599,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,bought this for my grandson as i had bought one a year before for my other grandson. Great for younger ones
600,Health & Beauty,5,Office purchase
601,Health & Beauty,4,not bad
602,Electronics,4,"Bought for my daughter. Has everything she needs, great value"
603,Health & Beauty,5,Just as good as name brands.
604,Health & Beauty,2,Don't seem to last very long changing brands
605,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Kindle fire is extremely easy to use. The protective foam layer is awesome.
606,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
607,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries at a great price.
608,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for batteries and they do last fairly long.
609,Health & Beauty,5,Great price will be ordering again!
610,Health & Beauty,5,I bought this for a friend.
611,Electronics,4,"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
612,Electronics,4,"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
613,Electronics,4,this was purchased for my granddaughter for her birthday
614,Health & Beauty,4,Comparable to the brand names...
615,Health & Beauty,2,"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long."
616,Electronics,3,"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
617,Health & Beauty,5,awesome
618,Health & Beauty,5,Great product.
619,Health & Beauty,5,"Long-lasting, high-quality batteries."
620,Electronics,3,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
621,Health & Beauty,4,"Relatively inexpensive (I guess the multiplack of Kirkland batteries sold by Costco would be cheaper, but I didn't want to buy a ton of these, I needed them quickly and they were delivered right to my Mom's house in two days....well worth it), and they seem to work well...only time will tell if they hold up in the Fulcrum 30010-301 LED Battery-Operated Stick-On Tap Light, Silver, 3 Pack I purchased along with them"
622,Electronics,4,Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
623,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
624,Electronics,4,Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
625,Electronics,4,This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
626,Electronics,4,You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
627,Electronics,4,While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
628,Electronics,4,I have a Kindle and my grandson uses it when he comes to visit. We decided to get him one.
629,Electronics,4,I think the amazon fire offer should include a stand/cover as standard. I enjoy mine a lot more since I was forced to purchase a stand/cover which holds the tablet. Would have preferred an instruction sheet to grt everything set up for use.
630,Electronics,4,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
631,Electronics,4,"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
632,Health & Beauty,5,Great price! Seems to work perfectly...and c'mon 48 for under 14...can't beat that with a stick!
633,Electronics,4,good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
634,Electronics,4,I have not explored all the features of the kindle fire tablet yet. Why does the sound always have to be reset each time? I want it to stay on full sound maximum loudness always. I have to reset it each time I fire it up to listen to music. What's up with that? Please direct me someone!!!
635,Health & Beauty,4,Inexpensive and decent quality battery for around the house.
636,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries. Love them
637,Health & Beauty,5,What else can you say Amazon ROCKS and so do their batteries!!!
638,Health & Beauty,5,great batteries and can't find them any cheaper.
639,Electronics,4,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
640,Electronics,4,Works great keeps a pretty good charge. My sign up for prime to get more bang for my buck but over all solid tablet
641,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and so far great quality
642,Electronics,4,this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
643,Electronics,4,"the tablet is very easy to set up, the connection to WFi was very straight forward and works reliably,"
644,Health & Beauty,3,Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(
645,Health & Beauty,5,"They are good, cheap batteries. Why waste your money on name brand These do the same thing!"
646,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries. They seem to last as long as big name brands for much less cost.
647,Health & Beauty,4,Seem good quality. Will update after seeing how they last.
648,Electronics,4,"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
649,Health & Beauty,4,These work great. However it should be noted these aren't rechargeable.
650,Health & Beauty,5,Great price on batteries
651,Health & Beauty,5,Great long lasting quality. I'll be back for more!
652,Health & Beauty,1,Junk...save your money... totally useless batteries that last hours if that.
653,Health & Beauty,3,Not bad i guess
654,Health & Beauty,5,"Am amazed at how well I'm loving your batteries, Amazom. I have been a loyal Duracell buyer, but find yours are not cost way less, but last longer. Would give them 10 stars if you allowed me."
655,Health & Beauty,5,What can you say about batteries They work.
656,Electronics,3,Good for beginners. Although you need to have a google account and a credit card to start up. For reading purposes only.
657,Electronics,4,"Using this with my Samsung Galaxy Note. Overall works fine, even though I'm on Gingerbread and not 3.0. Slim and lightweight. Pairs instantly. Some specialty keys don't work, but I'm not concerned as its purpose is just to get in text. This keyboard is much faster than the on-screen keyboard for inputting text.However, Amazon does not sell a case for this keyboard. This is a perfect travel keyboard, but carrying it bare in my day bag concerned me. I did a LOT of searching for some kind of generic slip case that would fit. Nothing.Then I stumbled on the Domke protective wrap, which is just a square of padded material with Velcro at the corners. It's designed for wrapping cameras and lenses. The 11 square fit the keyboard perfectly. I took it down to a local tailor shop and for 3 they sewed up the long side of the square when folded over on itself and one of the short sides creating a slip case. The protective wrap has a soft felt-like side and a nylon side. I folded it with the soft side on the inside. Now I have a perfect slip case for the keyboard, and for just about 15 (12 for the wrap from Amazon and 3 for the sewing)."
658,Electronics,4,"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
659,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Tablet is nice to play movies for kids. The amazon free play is Ok. Seems unorganized.
660,Electronics,4,Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
661,Health & Beauty,5,"What can I say. They are cheap and last as long as the copper top brand name. Don't waste your money on the brand, get the cheaper which is probably made by the brand anyways."
662,Health & Beauty,5,They seem to work okay so far and the price was great.
663,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are crap. Last a few days in xbox controller. Energizer lasts months. Don't waste your money.
664,Electronics,4,"This tablet exceeded my expectations. Strong processor, nice screen. Wish it had Bluetooth and was not so centered around Amazon prime."
665,Health & Beauty,4,Great value for the money.
666,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal you can find for AA's. And the Xbox controllers last for days with them. Just like a brand name battery!!!
667,Health & Beauty,3,ok
668,Electronics,4,"What you think you need more than a Kindle to surf the web? You don't. Cheap and effective. Plus it's an alarm clock too, plus with the right apps it's a radio, what's that you say a clock/radio? You know it hipsters."
669,Electronics,4,It‚Äôs really kid friendly and allows for total parental control. My 3 yr old was able to use it right outta the box.
670,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries are usually a good buy for the money. I have had leakage on one occasion and dead cells a couple of times, but overall I have been satisfied. I think these batteries are as good as any other on the market."
671,Health & Beauty,5,Works as they should.
672,Health & Beauty,1,Don't last long at all. I've had better luck with cheaper batteries than I've had with these. Duracell batteries in the same equipment with same usage lasted 4 times longer than these Amazon AA Batteries did.
673,Health & Beauty,5,works very good
674,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
675,Health & Beauty,1,"I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work."
676,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought it for my 4 year old and he loves it! The child case is awesome too in case of any drops.
677,Electronics,4,My kids love using it. They use it everyday with YouTube videos
678,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it! Long battery and is tough.She loves all the games and she learning so muchEveryday.
679,Health & Beauty,4,As advertised.
680,Health & Beauty,3,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.
681,Electronics,4,I use it everyday after work for down time.........
682,Electronics,4,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
683,"Electronics,Media",4,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
684,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
685,Health & Beauty,1,"Terrible - The product lasts less than a week in a home weather station, regardless if warm or cold weather. Cheap Rayovac batteries work just fine and I will stick with buying those locally at Menards."
686,Health & Beauty,5,I find these well priced and long lasting.
687,Electronics,4,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
688,Health & Beauty,4,good batteries and price
689,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
690,Electronics,1,"Bought this for my young son, because of the warranty. You are required to have a credit card stored in the account, and to turn on parental controls it blocks other features too like Alexa. This is the most ridiculous setup ever."
691,Health & Beauty,5,NICE TO HAVE WHEN NEEDED
692,Electronics,2,"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
693,Health & Beauty,5,Great value and quick service. Thank you.
694,Health & Beauty,5,I haven't had these batteries long enough to tell you if they last a long time or not but for the price you can't go wrong and I trust the Amazon basic batteries to be a better value than buying Energizer or Duracell batteries online that might come from a seller who is knocking them off from China
695,Electronics,4,"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
696,Health & Beauty,2,"I loved these batteries until 2 nights ago when one exploded in my camera flash. Not worth saving money on batteries when I now have to replace a 400 professional Nikon Flash. Battery acid leaked out of my flash door and all over my Nikon D600 camera and then on my hands before I realized what the loud,pop sound was."
697,Health & Beauty,3,Average at best
698,Electronics,3,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
699,Health & Beauty,5,love the batteries and will purchase in the future! highly recommend
700,Health & Beauty,4,seem to be working well
701,Electronics,4,"I am an ""old"" traditionalist and have always read from paper or hard back books. Now I don't lose what page I was on and have more shelf space where books used to be."
702,Health & Beauty,2,work but short life
703,Electronics,3,I got it because it was smaller and lighter than the original kindle fire. It is not as easy to operate as the original kindle fire.
704,Health & Beauty,5,"i am ready to do a full review on this product.Sins the package arrived in my house, i immediately take 2 aa battery and put it to my mac mouse,believe me mac mouse is 24/7 in use and it got me thru for 1 month and 1 week FEB / 19 - MAR / 25-26really good product"
705,Health & Beauty,5,Affordable. Long lasting battery life.
706,Health & Beauty,5,Not so surprised as AmazonBasics delivers excellent product. Work just like the Energizers and last as long.
707,Health & Beauty,5,Gets it done and looks shiny in the process
708,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It's nice but not as easy to switch profiles as I would like for it being a child's tablet. But overall easy to use just a lot of junk on main profile.
709,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"BestBuy was offering some discounts during Thanksgiving and this prompted me to buy. I was not an avid before and just casually bought this product. But I must admit, I am not at all disappointed with this. Works best with English books, does not work that well with native books. Also, this product is not backlit and does not have any option to increase the screen brightness and I would deduct 1 star for that. You need to install another product called Calibre in your computer to convert books to Kindle readable format (mobi). Kindle can also read PDF, but mobi format is better readable compared to Kindle."
710,Electronics,4,Wish I could download Google Docs but otherwise very happy with my kindle fire.
711,Electronics,4,Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
712,Health & Beauty,4,I use this mostly for my thermostat and it seems to last me about 3 weeks or so. I kind of expected it to last at least a month.
713,Health & Beauty,3,Can not tell the difference between these batteries and the name brands
714,Electronics,3,Good tablet althought the availability of apps thru their appstore is limited.
715,Electronics,4,Great for the price! Can't beat it. Good for a young kid or adult.
716,Health & Beauty,2,Battiers dont last very long
717,Electronics,4,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
718,Electronics,4,Got one for my son and hasn't put it down. Well till the timer shuts it off. He is 5 and loves it.
719,Health & Beauty,4,They last a long time.
720,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
721,Electronics,3,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook"
722,Health & Beauty,2,"I purchased these to try because I needed so many for my Christmas village. Withing 24 hours some of the batteries died so I turned off all of them so I could at least have them on for Christmas. I am very disappointed in them, had to go out and purchase more of the copper top ones which last weeks and weeks to keep my village lit for the holidays. I will not purchase these again."
723,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
724,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries go with the Etekcity Lantern's, have not had a chance to use them."
725,Health & Beauty,5,Good Deal!
726,Electronics,3,Its a good one but didn't set for my 6 year old.So had to return it back !
727,Health & Beauty,5,Good for the money
728,Health & Beauty,1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
729,Health & Beauty,4,they are batteries and they make my battery powered stuff work so im not sure how this could get a low rating. for the price well worth it. that said they don't seem to last quite as long as other name brands.
730,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect
731,Health & Beauty,5,They last as long as Duracell batteries in my Xbox one controllers and none of them exploded like some of the reviews said.
732,Electronics,4,"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
733,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT QUALITY
734,Electronics,4,"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
735,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet to replace one I had (different brand) that was worn out. This is a pretty good tablet for the price. I just wanted something to use til I could get something bigger. I've had no problems with it other than some of the games I played on my other one not being available on the Fire.
736,Health & Beauty,5,Item arrived on time and was as described
737,Electronics,4,"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
738,Health & Beauty,4,"These are great for the price! They do tend to die slightly faster than other batteries, but overall they are great for what you pay. I would recommend these to anyone looking for basic batteries. The come in a plastic wrap which is easy to open. The same can't be said about some battery brands."
739,Health & Beauty,5,real good tuff
740,Electronics,4,"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
741,Health & Beauty,4,These work just fine.
742,Health & Beauty,5,Great way to buy batteries!
743,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent value.
744,Electronics,4,"My Dad, retired Vietnam veteran, received this as a gift and he Loves it so much. Very user friendly and great quality for the price."
745,Health & Beauty,3,"I'm not too thrilled with the life of these batteries. They don't seem to last as long as energizer does. And in some things, they aren't even strong enough to get rid of the 'dead battery' reading."
746,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,I purchased this Kindle for my daughter and she really enjoys using it !!
747,Electronics,4,"Very satisfied with my tablet ,it is very easy to operate."
748,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Fire tablet is a great starter tablet for people that are looking for an inexpensive way to read your e-books, and watch your videos."
749,Health & Beauty,5,exactly what I wanted
750,Health & Beauty,5,As described
751,Health & Beauty,1,"I opened the package today and put in my son car toy, didn't work at all, I took them out and put back in again, didn't work, so I got the other brand battery and put them in, the car run just fine. I'm going to return this and will not buy amazon battery again."
752,Electronics,4,"This device is a nice starter tablet for kids. The Fire OS with Freetime Unlimited (free for 1 year) is an excellent environment. The warranty is great, and had we kept the device I'm sure we would have had the opportunity to use it. However, the device we received in the ""Kids Edition"" box was not registered as a ""Kids Edition"" with Amazon, thus the FreetimeUnlimited plan only lasted 30 days and the ""Kids Edition"" warranty did not apply. Amazon could not register the Fire as a ""Kids Edition"" so it was returned."
753,Electronics,1,"Cumbersome, complicated and not kid friendly..... went with Apple, suggesting you do too."
754,Health & Beauty,1,Better at the dollar store no matter what the brand
755,Health & Beauty,3,"I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future."
756,Electronics,4,"This is a very basic, functional backpack that does the job that it when designed for. Unlike other, more expensive models, this one does not have the feel or look of something that you would show off to your friends. However, it holds my 16 laptop quite well and has enough pockets to contain all of my usual travel gear. The material seems to be fairly durable but it makes a crinkly sound when touched or moved. This would be a good choice for a teenager who is hard on his belongings."
757,Electronics,4,This item was for my 5 year old he loves it he's able to rent books from library surf web and play games a parents dream
758,Health & Beauty,4,i love it
759,Electronics,4,Works great to control Alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes. gets very loud at least. Easily connects to Bluetooth.
760,Electronics,4,Very easy to setup and use. Still learning to maximize the usage. The instructio is too simple and not cover much using Alexa .
761,Electronics,3,it was great for reading but the lag time for loading videos was a little bit longer than an iPad
762,Electronics,4,Would give 5 stars but THE ADDS!!!!!! Just as functional as my iPad
763,Electronics,3,I purchased this to download books for school. Screen too small and OS was not to my liking
764,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon brand just as good as big name brands and way cheaper. Never buying another brand again!
765,Electronics,4,"My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet."
766,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Great tablet for kids. The free replacement policy is great as well. Does take a bit of effort to set up, but pretty easy for the kids to use."
767,Health & Beauty,5,"good price, worked fine"
768,Electronics,4,Grandson loves his new tablet. Had to set him up as an adult because Amazon had too many restrictions for child account
769,Health & Beauty,5,"Great deal, long lasting life."
770,Health & Beauty,5,no complaint
771,Health & Beauty,5,Will use again
772,Electronics,4,"Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
773,Health & Beauty,1,a few in the lot didn't work at all.
774,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent product!!
775,Electronics,3,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started
776,Electronics,3,"bought a few kindles in the past but this time one of it came defective. the port was bent and it was hard to charge but still possible. comes in 4 different color. was 16gb enough space for kids, has camera, ok quality not the best but ok for pics taken by kids"
777,Health & Beauty,5,A lot of batteries for a great price
778,Electronics,4,A good choice for younger children. I bought for a 4 year old to replace a Nabi. However it doesn't have as many app choices as an Android device
779,Health & Beauty,1,This is sth i never had with other serious brands. disappointing and returning
780,Health & Beauty,4,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
781,Health & Beauty,5,Good product.
782,Electronics,3,It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
783,Health & Beauty,1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
784,Electronics,4,"Nice tablet to work - Works perfectly, Rock solid."
785,Health & Beauty,5,So far these have held up well against the more expensive brands.
786,Electronics,3,Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
787,Electronics,2,"I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend."
788,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The Amazon - Fire Kids Edition - 7 Tablet - 16gb - Pink is a great tablet
789,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"This is my second kindle. As I travel a lot, I love the ability to get electronic versions of books both through Amazon and my local library."
790,Health & Beauty,2,"I normally buy the Maxwell brand but thought I'd give these a try. I used them in my led battery operated lights, they were dead in half the time of the Maxwells."
791,Health & Beauty,2,"Lasted one month in my carbon monoxide detector. Maybe these are good for other applications, but disappointed with their performance."
792,Health & Beauty,1,Junk - after trying 10 batteries one worked!
793,Electronics,4,I already had a Fire but it didn't have enough storage space. This tablet solved that problem for me. However I'm unable to download Dropbox because it is already installed on my previous tablet and this tablet is a little different. I did however figure out that I could install One Drive and then put my photos into that program. Otherwise it is a good tablet.
794,Health & Beauty,3,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.
795,Electronics,4,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
796,Health & Beauty,5,Well packaged and seems ok for the price.
797,Health & Beauty,5,They perform well.
798,Electronics,1,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
799,Electronics,3,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
800,Health & Beauty,5,Work great and are a great price. Can't beat that! These seem to be on par with low to mid tier brand battery live so can't complain.
801,Health & Beauty,3,"Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place."
802,Electronics,4,"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
803,Electronics,4,"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
804,Health & Beauty,5,Work like a charm
805,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Great! It's very good. I will buy it next time. Thanks.
806,Health & Beauty,5,awesome
807,Health & Beauty,5,Seems to be as good as the average battery bought in a store. Nice amount for a good price. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now
808,Electronics,3,"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
809,Electronics,4,Grandkids and adult parents love it. The parents texted and the grandkids play games.
810,Electronics,4,My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
811,Electronics,4,"I bough this for my daughter and it's perfect for her little tiny hands, I just wish that the screen would lock when she is watching her shows because she gets excited and touches the screen and it pauses or chances the show or it goes to other apps. Overall it's a great product for a small child"
812,Health & Beauty,5,these batteries are just ok
813,Health & Beauty,4,What can I say. They're AA Alkaline Batteries and they're affordable.-1 Star because the packaging was GIGANTIC compared to the size of the actual batteries.
814,Health & Beauty,5,"Good price, seems to last as long as name brands I used to pay more for."
815,Electronics,4,Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
816,Health & Beauty,5,THEY SEEM GOOD*
817,Health & Beauty,1,"Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries."
818,Health & Beauty,1,Don't bother. The AA's I bought got remotes last a third as long as everready batteries.
819,Electronics,4,It's good for doing a number of basic tasks. The Amazon Underground feature is really cool. It feels like an Android but more limited.
820,Electronics,4,I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
821,Electronics,4,"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
822,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This kindle is very slow at recharging. Granddaughter has a hard time waiting for it to charge.
823,Electronics,4,The is an entry level tablet for those who are looking for a budget tablet. I believe you can only access to Amazon App Store - which has fewer apps as compared to Apple Store and Google Play.
824,Health & Beauty,5,I believe this one is more better than Duracell. Will buy again .
825,Electronics,4,Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
826,Health & Beauty,2,I don't know how these batteries got such great reviews. They don't last nearly as long as the brand name batteries. Don't buy these unless you want to change batteries in your kids' toys and remote controls all the time. I'm super loyal to Amazon...but not with this product.
827,Health & Beauty,5,A lot for the price. Havnt used then yet
828,Health & Beauty,4,Good price for a commodity item that is used around the house. Quantity is just enough so you have batteries on hand yet few enough to keep the stock fresh.
829,Health & Beauty,5,Just what I needed.
830,Health & Beauty,3,"I use them for Xbox one controllers, 2 batteries last maybe 2 weeks in my controller, but you get a good amount in the box. Might just look into rechargeable batteries. Tv remotes last longer obviously. 48 batteries for 12 was an easy sell though for me"
831,Electronics,4,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
832,Electronics,4,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
833,Health & Beauty,5,What a great deal!!! Haven't had an issue with the battery once!
834,Health & Beauty,5,Convenient to have several available...in the refrig.
835,Electronics,4,Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
836,Health & Beauty,2,"So these are cheap batteries, and you get what you pay for. However, when used in trail cameras during cold weather the performance is poor. Cheap Rayovac batteries from Menards (48AA for about 13.00) perform much better. Will not purchase again."
837,Electronics,4,you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it Plays all my music
838,Health & Beauty,5,Favorite brand in my household. Great price and long lasting.
839,Electronics,4,My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
840,Electronics,4,Its worth every penny. The kids loved it our home is quieter then ever.
841,Health & Beauty,2,Good price but batteries don't last long compared to other brands
842,Electronics,4,Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
843,Electronics,4,Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
844,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!
845,Electronics,4,Pros: preloaded with everything your kids will need.Cons: need to buy at least 32GB microSD with it.
846,Electronics,4,This fit my criteria of a low cost tablet that works well
847,Health & Beauty,5,works
848,Electronics,3,The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.
849,Health & Beauty,1,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
850,Health & Beauty,4,"Their basic AA batteries. I haven't done any detailed tests, but they seem to be working as well as any Alkaline batters we've purchased before. They are a great value as they are much cheaper per battery than any of the other name brands."
851,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,It does its job but I would buy one which the screen is brighter. There are times that it's difficult to read because screen is not too bright
852,Health & Beauty,5,"Duran muchisimo, lo recomiendo"
853,Health & Beauty,5,"Hold up really well in my son's toys, better than most so far and last a few days in my hubby's Xbox controller, but mind you the thing is hardly ever not in his hands so that's actually a pretty good span compared to others we've used."
854,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My daughter loves this tablet. She can navigate through the apps with ease.
855,Health & Beauty,5,ok
856,Electronics,4,We bought this for my son to watch his videos on the road when traveling and it has been a lifesaver. Very kid friendly.
857,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal and at your door in two days with prime no complaints. Batteries seem comparable with name brands!
858,Electronics,3,I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
859,Electronics,4,"Tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound. AI app Alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches. Overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool,"
860,Health & Beauty,5,works great
861,Health & Beauty,5,great
862,Health & Beauty,2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
863,Health & Beauty,1,I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.
864,Health & Beauty,5,So simple and easy. Batteries come in a cardboard box that you use for storage.
865,Health & Beauty,5,great batteries
866,Health & Beauty,1,"We used in an August smart lock. We expected to get about 2-3 months of use based on the energizer batteries that came with the lock, but batteries died in 2 weeks."
867,Electronics,4,"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
868,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and they hold up for awhile with my kids toys!
869,Electronics,4,I bought this for my niece for a Christmas gift.she is 9 years old and she love it.
870,Health & Beauty,5,they work
871,Electronics,4,Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
872,Electronics,4,"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson."
873,Health & Beauty,5,As good as others at a lower price.
874,Health & Beauty,5,Average use is good.
875,Electronics,4,Its very nice and not as big as the echo. Didn't know there was a Tap available to buy.
876,Electronics,4,"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well."
877,Electronics,4,Wife loves her Kindle and has used it for years. Thought it was time to update to take advantage of new features and bigger display.
878,Electronics,3,"The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that."
879,Electronics,4,"I have two of these for my kids. Ages 2 and 3. They are great for them to watch cartoons and they are slowly getting into the puzzles, books and games on them. Easy to setup and link to amazon account. Only gave it 4 stars because the one downfall is that these tablets are bit on the slow side when either downloading content or loading up some videos. Kids are less patient than adults you know. Overall, well worth the money."
880,Electronics,4,"Works good, has very nice screen brightness and resolution"
881,Health & Beauty,1,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
882,Health & Beauty,4,Great value
883,Health & Beauty,5,"So far, these hold up really well. For the price, they are simply unbeatable. They come packaged in a small, generic box. I've now tried 4 AmazonBasics products, and I haven't got a complaint about any so far. Amazon seems to not only want to make cheap products, but they also don't seem to want to get complaints and returns as well. Who has time for all of the mess So, do it right the first time, and see what happens.Thanks for another great product!*If my review was helpful in any way, please click the little YES button. If not, just laugh and move on."
884,Electronics,4,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
885,Health & Beauty,5,Boom-Shacka-Lacka-Lacka! Great price!
886,Health & Beauty,4,"They seem like a good value, thus far. If they last as long as expected, 5 stars may be in order."
887,Electronics,4,Both of my kids love this tablet. The option to set it up for the kids is great. My 7 year old likes to play in parent mode conpaired to the kids side cause there are not a lot of options for him. Very good product would buy again
888,Health & Beauty,1,"The batteries suck. I have them in my mouse and I have to replace them every week. My Duracell's would last a month. I feel like they are only 1/2 charged, I put new ones in my flash for my high quality camera, and the flash was really slow and dim. Pretty crappy for new batteries. I am not pleased"
889,Electronics,3,"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
890,Health & Beauty,1,WHAT A HORRENDOUS PRODUCT. I THOUGHT THAT BEING FROM AMAZON IT WOULD BE GOOD. WRONG!!!! IT'S STILL CHINESE FIRST.LASTS NOTHING (2 WEEKS IN MY COMPUTER MOUSE). DISASTROUS DISAPPOINTMENT. FIRST TIME I AM LET DOWN BY AMAZON. PITY! I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL AND LESS GULLIBLE.
891,Health & Beauty,5,"Price per battery is great. I checked the voltage on some of them and they were all at 1.6V. I think they will last at least as long as the brand name batteries, although I wouldn't be surprised if I were to learn they are all made by the same people and just labeled differently."
892,Electronics,4,Very good product that I purchased for my godson. The only issue is the charger / charging port is having some difficulties. Will be bringing back to the store to have it looked at. My just be my 2 year old godson being a kid with it :) He loves it otherwise.
893,Health & Beauty,5,I like how easy and fast it is to order these batteries. This is a really good price for the convenience aspect.
894,Health & Beauty,1,Bought these batteries because of the 4 - 5 star ratings from verified purchases.....what These are the worst batteries I've ever used! 1 week of these batteries 1 month or more of brand name batteries.
895,Health & Beauty,4,"ok, my fault didn't pay attention, these are not rechargable"
896,Electronics,1,"I don't recommend buying this. After 1 month of buying this, it won't charge or turn on."
897,Electronics,4,"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
898,Health & Beauty,5,Stock up Now folks.
899,Electronics,4,"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
900,Health & Beauty,5,excellent
901,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Compares well to major brands
902,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect transaction A+++
903,Health & Beauty,5,Like that I can buy these online and in bulk. Have ordered them several times. A good buy
904,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality batteries. Highly recommended and will continue to buy. Really good price too!
905,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. I don't think they last nearly as long as some of the bigger name brands. But can not be beat for price.
906,Electronics,4,"Light weight, easy to use, love the lighted background. I am unable to make it stay on page count it keeps going back to hours left to read. But other then that a great ereader."
907,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I did read about the game prior to buying it but so far the game is only half decent. Too much of the same thing.
908,Health & Beauty,3,"I mean, it's a crap ton of batteries for a decent price. They just die quickly."
909,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
910,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for learning apps and surfing internet for my 7 year old kid and also good protection
911,Electronics,4,Easy to set up and start using right away. I connect it to wifi and it works pretty good. Buffers a lot when I walk around with it and am trying to watch a show or something. Phone seems to work better on wifi. But it has good picture quality and a long battery life.
912,Electronics,4,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
913,Health & Beauty,1,"Gave these a fair chance but the fact is they simply do not last as long as Duracells. I've gone through more than half of the pack I purchased and I am easily replacing batteries twice as fast for the same devices, same use. I won't repurchase."
914,Health & Beauty,2,DID NOT LAST LONG
915,Electronics,4,Love this tablet easy to use and extremely affordable
916,Health & Beauty,5,I always order amazon product. Cheaper and good quality
917,Electronics,4,"I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars."
918,Electronics,1,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
919,Electronics,4,Worked well as expected. I would recommend this product.
920,Electronics,4,"great tablet for kids, and for the price a great value."
921,Health & Beauty,5,"I like that these were wrapped in plastic in sets of 4 to help keep them organized. These worked well and restocked my battery storage area. The box was simple and compact, no larger than it had to be - this is never the case at big box stores. Thanks, Amazon!"
922,Electronics,4,It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
923,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and (so far) I haven't realized any noticeable differences between these and the other name brand batteries.
924,Electronics,4,I love this tablet. Works great for my needs. Ebooks Facebook light gaming. Internet is a little slow but it's $40 what can I say. I installed Google chrome for more apps.
925,Health & Beauty,4,"Each battery only lasts a few days on my wireless mouse.Update: the problem is actually with my mouse or computer other batteries are also draining too fast. Nevertheless, it would be good if these Amazon batteries stated their capacity."
926,Electronics,4,"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
927,Electronics,4,Hy husband loves his kindle.the back light so he can read anywhere with low eye strain is awsome
928,Electronics,4,"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
929,Health & Beauty,5,Last as long as your average name brand batteries. No complaints.
930,Electronics,4,"Quite complex and troublesome, with poor features. It does not store music or file and keep ponying to various sites"
931,Electronics,4,Love that it's 'interactive' as long as I'm connected to the wifi or via Bluetooth to my phone! The sound is pretty good - tends to get a little 'tinny' sounding if you turn it up too loud. But overall a good sound. I'm still trying to find Alexa's limits on what she can and can't do!!
932,Electronics,4,"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
933,Health & Beauty,5,"These batteries rock, and they last a long time and are way cheaper than other batteries."
934,Electronics,3,"I bought one for myself and a couple as gifts, it's cute but still haven't figured out what's so great about it. I will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room."
935,Electronics,4,First time using Amazon Fire programming. So far my child and I love the apps and programs. I really love the parental limits and time limits I can set. And that I can set learning and reading limits before play.
936,Health & Beauty,5,Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping. Arrived in perfect condition and did exactly what I needed it to. Great purchase and would purchase again.
937,Health & Beauty,4,Works well for the price point and is completely comparable to name brand batteries. I will be purchasing all of my future battery needs from amazon basics.
938,Health & Beauty,5,"Dependable, as usual."
939,Health & Beauty,4,general use
940,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good!
941,Electronics,1,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
942,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Battery dies after an hour...should last longer for the money. Will not bold charge.
943,Health & Beauty,5,"Why buy regular batteries when these work just as well, but cost less!"
944,Electronics,4,"My grandson loves it! It's exactly what he needed. I'm very pleased with it, and so is he!"
945,Electronics,3,"I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it."
946,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
947,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,It is affordable and it had Increased storage but no backlight and the screen could be better!
948,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries, they last long!"
949,Health & Beauty,5,They are batteries. They work. That's all that matters.
950,Electronics,2,The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
951,Health & Beauty,5,"These batteries wor great on my tv remote. Until they die, then you have to replace them"
952,Health & Beauty,5,They work great
953,Health & Beauty,4,"these are the only AA batteries i buy now, great price and outlasts any of the batteries from the big box stores"
954,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
955,Health & Beauty,5,perfect cheap batteries
956,Health & Beauty,2,I bought them to go into a flashlight. They never lasted more that a few hours and got really dim. maybe good for things like remote controls
957,Health & Beauty,5,"Good price, good quality and shipping time much less expensive than at the local drugstore. will buy again.."
958,Electronics,4,Love the choice of colors. Have two kindles of my own and purchased this for a gift.
959,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
960,Health & Beauty,5,Good value for money and good deal. Glad I bought it
961,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent set of batteries, very affordable, and comes with a nice packaging. I won't be buying batteries from retail stores anymore."
962,Electronics,4,"If you want a basic reader that can be used as a mini tablet, then this is a good deal for the price"
963,Health & Beauty,5,As expected
964,Health & Beauty,5,THESE are always a good buy.
965,Electronics,4,"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
966,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are junk. Some of the new once have no more power than the once they replaced. If they are good, they ware out very quickly. I don't like to make negative reports, but these are so bad!"
967,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries work as expected. No noticeable difference in the mAh
968,Health & Beauty,2,I would have gotten the same quality had I got batteries from the dollar store. I was very disappointed.
969,Electronics,3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
970,Electronics,4,"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
971,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
972,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the price
973,Health & Beauty,5,thanks
974,Health & Beauty,3,Good: but don't seem to last as long as major brands
975,Health & Beauty,5,I spoil my cats rotten with toys. They burn through AA bats like a lonely middle aged woman. This is the cheapest way to get them. I just wish they didn't plastic wrap them in bundles of 4.
976,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for a great price.
977,Health & Beauty,3,Have not had the opportunity ti critique
978,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
979,Health & Beauty,5,So far they seem as good as the major brands. Second time have ordered and have had no issues with the quality versus the name brands.
980,Health & Beauty,3,do not seem to last as long as other batteries
981,Electronics,4,Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
982,Electronics,2,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
983,Electronics,3,Not enough features. It's to simple. When parental control is on it's not much you can do on the tablet not even use the camera
984,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries dead as of June 1. I did not use half of then. Good for 6 months.
985,Health & Beauty,5,Fanastic!!
986,Electronics,4,My son loves this tablet built tough and sturdy at great price
987,Electronics,1,"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
988,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries.
989,Health & Beauty,5,"Works as it should, no problems"
990,Health & Beauty,5,work great
991,Electronics,4,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
992,Health & Beauty,3,Some of the batteries did not work well.
993,Health & Beauty,1,I don't know who made these batteries but they are worthless. They do not hold a charge.I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
994,Electronics,4,This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one
995,Health & Beauty,5,Good
996,Electronics,4,"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
997,Health & Beauty,5,Very good batteries
998,Health & Beauty,5,Great performance great price.
999,Electronics,4,The tablet overall is nice a little laggy simply because we're avid Apple users however the games that's are free in the free time area are amazing the way that Amazon takes measures to keep the kids safe is like non other I'd definitely recommend this product just if you're used to Apple it will take some getting used to.
1000,Electronics,4,This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books.
1001,Health & Beauty,5,Last about 8 hours of non stop use which is about average. But the price was AMAZING!
1002,Health & Beauty,5,Best value for batteries!
1003,Electronics,1,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
1004,Health & Beauty,5,it was ok
1005,Electronics,4,This tablet has great graphics and clarity. The screen is is just right for a nighttime reader.
1006,Health & Beauty,5,Good price. Batteries last long enough.
1007,Health & Beauty,3,Works
1008,Health & Beauty,5,work great
1009,Health & Beauty,5,Good buy
1010,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,great the kids love it for learning on and great on long trips
1011,Electronics,4,"Extra features are nice and upgrading from the Kindle Paperwhite was fairly simple. Amazon did an automatic system update which was not cool. There should have been an option to update when we wanted, not when they wanted."
1012,Electronics,4,"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you."
1013,Electronics,4,"The only issue with this kindle is the price, otherwise, it's awesome. Light, compact, with a long battery life and tons of features... like an automatic backlight which is useful if you read at night."
1014,Electronics,4,It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
1015,Health & Beauty,5,On time and as described.
1016,Health & Beauty,1,These worked for about a week. Then started leaking and just stopped working. I ended up throwing them away. I even had to throw a string of lights out because of the leaks of batteries.
1017,Electronics,4,"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
1018,Health & Beauty,5,"Great seller, awesome product!"
1019,Electronics,4,Good tablet for my baby.keeps him busy. I love it.
1020,Electronics,4,I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
1021,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This product is a great learning tool for my 4yr old toddler. It's has the option for kid mode or regular tablet mode.
1022,Electronics,4,"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
1023,Health & Beauty,4,Cheap and good.
1024,Health & Beauty,4,Good.
1025,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
1026,Health & Beauty,5,As expected
1027,Health & Beauty,5,"Well, I've only used 3 of these for about an hour but they are lovely so far."
1028,Electronics,4,"Size, brightness, and convenience are good. The option to link with android products for messages is a little hard."
1029,Electronics,4,"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
1030,Health & Beauty,5,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT,GREAT QUALITY AND VALUE"
1031,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries are holding up well with my battery operated LED candles.
1032,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries. They work. Simple as that.
1033,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"First time buying a kindle, mostly for my 4 years old to have his own device so he won't use our iPad.Pro: light and has padded protection all around so it won't damage. Kid friendly.Con: hard to navigate and go to YouTube directly. We have always use the Apple device so it was hard for us to figure out where everything is. My son uses YouTube mostly and he gets frustrated when he can't find the app. After few months we are still learning to use this devise."
1034,Electronics,4,Good device with large screen and easy to operate for kids.
1035,Health & Beauty,1,All were dead
1036,Health & Beauty,5,That's pretty a lot
1037,Electronics,4,"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
1038,Health & Beauty,5,Battery life lasting much longer than expected.
1039,Electronics,3,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
1040,Health & Beauty,2,"poor performer, does not last long at all."
1041,Health & Beauty,1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
1042,Health & Beauty,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
1043,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
1044,Health & Beauty,5,good price
1045,Electronics,4,I bought this as a gift and it has performed perfectly. Can't beat at this price.
1046,Electronics,3,It's an ok tablet because you need to have an Amazon account in order to download free apps
1047,Health & Beauty,3,A lot of batteries for the good price. But they don't last too long.
1048,Health & Beauty,5,Great. Thank you.
1049,Health & Beauty,2,"While these batteries work, they don't last as long as expected. They lasted about 1/2 the time as a standard store bought battery (Energizer/Duracell/Rayovac). I will not buy these again. In contrast, the Amazon Basics AA Rechargeable is Awesome."
1050,Electronics,3,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
1051,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing price for all of these batteries!
1052,Health & Beauty,4,Work good
1053,Health & Beauty,4,good price haven't had any go TU yet
1054,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries. No complaints.
1055,Health & Beauty,5,The batteries is very goood!
1056,Electronics,4,Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
1057,Health & Beauty,5,"Great value for batteries in bulk - our household expends batteries quickly, so it's great to always have a backup supply.The low cost of these means I can afford to keep plenty on hand. The quality is comparable to most other brands we've tried - especially for video game controllers and the like."
1058,Health & Beauty,1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
1059,Health & Beauty,1,Battery storage life only lasted 8 months (stored indoors).
1060,Electronics,3,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
1061,Electronics,4,"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
1062,Electronics,4,"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
1063,Electronics,3,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
1064,Electronics,4,"Hadn't really checked into Kindles/tablets before. Does more than I expected it too, tho now I'm a little disappointed that it's a little limited to Amazon-related and approved stuff. The app store for the device is more limited even tho it uses a form of Android (which means no Flash also). But I'm mostly using it for reading, so I'm happy with it and would recommend it. The 8 was the perfect size for me, the 6 screen was too small for reading comfortably and the 10 was too big as a handheld."
1065,Electronics,1,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
1066,Health & Beauty,1,"Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC"
1067,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT
1068,Health & Beauty,5,They're adorable.
1069,Electronics,3,I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
1070,Health & Beauty,5,very nice
1071,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries die super fast!
1072,Electronics,4,Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
1073,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"my wife had a kindle for 10 years and it finally died on her , this was a great replacement"
1074,Health & Beauty,5,Work fine but run out an it quickly.
1075,Health & Beauty,5,Great product! Reasonable price! Fast shipping!
1076,Health & Beauty,5,Seems to fix the faulty cable on my son's headset well.
1077,Electronics,4,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
1078,Health & Beauty,4,Another great price for batteries!
1079,Electronics,4,"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
1080,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for a ton of batteries.
1081,Electronics,1,So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
1082,Health & Beauty,5,"I've been using these batteries for awhile now, and I'm very happy with their performance. The quality and the price are top notch!"
1083,Electronics,4,For its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and I love the portability.
1084,Electronics,4,It would have been nice if the charging cord was more compatible with other devices.
1085,Health & Beauty,5,good
1086,Health & Beauty,4,"I don't know if they are the best or not but they work, and are cheaper."
1087,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
1088,Health & Beauty,5,as advertised
1089,Health & Beauty,3,you get what you pay for... they are not great
1090,Health & Beauty,2,2 way radio drained batteries daily so too expensive
1091,Electronics,4,"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
1092,Health & Beauty,4,"It seems every toy my 2 year old currently owns has batteries in it for the price, I can't find a better deal on a battery than these.I don't know about all that fancy ratings that other reviewers write about, but I know when I put these in a toy for my son, he starts smiling again. That's all I need from a product."
1093,Electronics,4,Bought this gift for my wife and she loves it. Works as expected.
1094,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
1095,Health & Beauty,5,Always worked well in my tools and controllers. Cheap. Dont forget to recycle
1096,Health & Beauty,1,"I am now trying to use the batteries and basically they are not working. Perhaps they are old, but they are just plain not working. I put in a Duracell and my headphones work. I put any one of the 36 batteries in the headphones - and it is not working. It is not worth the effort to get my 10 back."
1097,Electronics,4,"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
1098,Electronics,3,Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
1099,Health & Beauty,2,Tried this out. Loved the box. The package of individuals of 4 each is nice but not convenient at times. We tried these on a high drain police radio and a low drain Samsung personal radio.STICKING WITH MAXELL. They out perform these and its noticeable for about 3 more. Better value.
1100,Electronics,4,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
1101,Electronics,1,This product is not user friendly much less kid friendly. Took them back for samsungs.
1102,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries that work. Seem to last the same as other major brands, but cheaper to buy. A no-brainer."
1103,Health & Beauty,5,good product
1104,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I got this for my 3 years old girl and she loves it. Very fast she was able to figure out the games and how to work with it. I have some concern like the port for charger is so bad and easy to break knowing kids are using it. Battery life is short and dosent last but anything else seems to be ok.
1105,Health & Beauty,2,"I've used theses batteries in several devices now, and they always run out of juice much faster than typical AA batteries."
1106,Health & Beauty,4,thank you
1107,Electronics,4,Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
1108,Electronics,4,I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
1109,Health & Beauty,4,Ok
1110,Health & Beauty,3,"These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)"
1111,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Very durable and keeps my 5yr old entertained. I have to limit his use. Lots of apps/games that incorporate learning. Very age appropriate and safe. No worries on what my child is being exposed to.
1112,Health & Beauty,5,"Everyone needs batteries these are great for the price. Ship quick thanks to Amazon, and they actually do last!"
1113,Health & Beauty,4,fast delivery and works as expected
1114,Electronics,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
1115,Electronics,4,Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
1116,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries...They work...And make other stuff work. Yay!
1117,Health & Beauty,4,"Excellent value, good batteries"
1118,Electronics,4,This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
1119,Electronics,3,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
1120,Health & Beauty,2,"ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it."
1121,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries die very fast. These are used in a remote and I have replaced them 4 times within a year. The previous batteries lasted 3 years.
1122,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and batteries are fully charged
1123,Health & Beauty,4,Thanks!
1124,Health & Beauty,5,Lasts as long as the competitors!
1125,Health & Beauty,5,So far they seem to work okay
1126,Electronics,4,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
1127,Health & Beauty,5,nice
1128,Health & Beauty,5,Arrived quickly and as promised. Thank you.
1129,Health & Beauty,4,As described
1130,Electronics,4,The original electronic book. Bought it for my wife who reads paper book at two to three a week. She's hooked and loves the Kindle.
1131,Electronics,4,"My baby boy has one, I knew my girl would love it as well. Fun games and the AppStore has access to new games and books."
1132,Electronics,4,The sound and screen quality are great and I like the blue light cutoff feature.I found that toggling back & forth online to be clumsy compared to a tablet.It is lightweight and easier to handle for long periods of time.
1133,Electronics,3,"I wish the tablet was faster and more consistent. It is ok as a first tablet, but not for someone who has owned many and wants to do many things with it."
1134,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.
1135,Health & Beauty,5,"works great, no dead or short lived batts"
1136,Health & Beauty,1,Bought a box of 36 aaa batteries and all batteries were dead. Don't waste your money. The only way I rated it 1one star is because it would not except ZERO stars which is what this product deserves.
1137,Health & Beauty,5,Work as advertised and fair price.
1138,Electronics,4,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
1139,Health & Beauty,4,"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries. It was getting pretty expensive at the store. Found these, ordered them. Using them. They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!"
1140,Electronics,3,Having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do.
1141,Electronics,4,Awesome tablet. Purchased for kids. They love it..
1142,Electronics,4,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
1143,Electronics,4,"this was a christmas present, for the nephew works good, he loves it"
1144,Electronics,4,It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
1145,Health & Beauty,5,Bought for me.
1146,Health & Beauty,5,Totally satisfied
1147,"Electronics,Media",4,Easy to handle. Light weight. I like that it automatically shuts off when the cover is closed.
1148,Health & Beauty,5,last pretty long
1149,Health & Beauty,4,"We normally like to use rechargeable batteries but we have a few items that say not to use them so we bought these to use in those items. These batteries seem to work well so far everything is going well with them. They seem to be lasting okay, we did have a couple that seemed to run down quickly, we are chalking that up to the fact that my son left the device they were in on for an extended amount of time.We will continue to use the rest of the batteries and see how the rest of them perform. I will post an update if we find we have anymore that rundown quickly."
1150,Health & Beauty,4,"These are great batteries without paying the premium for name brands. Our kids go through batteries like their potato chips, so its nice to get a good product at a reasonable price."
1151,Health & Beauty,2,Important Part missing - the power cordStained and 2 different colored remotesNot acceptable
1152,Health & Beauty,5,It's good
1153,Health & Beauty,3,"I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value."
1154,Health & Beauty,4,Lot of batteries for the price and the seem to work just as well as any name brands I have tried in the past.
1155,Electronics,1,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
1156,Health & Beauty,3,"Doesn't hold the strength of Duracell, etc."
1157,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries did not do the job for us. They were low powered and did not last as long as their competition.I thought all AA batteries were the same but after our experience with these I have to say that you get what you pay for.I am not sure how or why they are different than other batteries, lower voltage less capacitanceThey are cheap - do not buy them."
1158,Electronics,3,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
1159,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!
1160,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Really great love tge tablet really easy for my daughter, learning! I do wish it had more storage, and more items for kids. But we do love the tablet."
1161,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Solid battery. What more do ya want
1162,Health & Beauty,5,Good price for AAA batteries.
1163,Electronics,4,But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
1164,Electronics,4,"We got this for a young girl who is 9. She loves it and there a lot of Apps that she likes. There are parental controls which is a plus, recommend for almost any age group."
1165,Electronics,4,Mostly just use it for the speaker. Still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding.
1166,Health & Beauty,5,Good for the value.
1167,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
1168,Health & Beauty,5,I went around and changed batteries for all devices. Thanks Amazon.
1169,Electronics,4,"My daughter is totally enjoying her tablet.Recently though, it is not charging correctly. I will come to store to have it looked at."
1170,Health & Beauty,1,"Really good price for a reason, first two batteries I used were dead. Do not waste your money!"
1171,Health & Beauty,5,Great
1172,Electronics,4,"Bought as gift for my granddaughter who is 10. She loves it. Plays games, watches videos and listens to music."
1173,Electronics,4,"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."
1174,Health & Beauty,5,as expected
1175,Electronics,3,This has been pretty easy for my kids to use and navigate. They really like it.
1176,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries cant beat the price!
1177,Electronics,4,"It's very good tablet for < $100, fast and light, good for everyday use and bring along for travel."
1178,Electronics,4,"If reading is what you do the most with your tablet, this is good choice!"
1179,Electronics,3,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
1180,Electronics,4,This tablet is very good for my daughter of age five.
1181,Health & Beauty,2,Half of the batteries were just dead
1182,Health & Beauty,5,Great so far! Love the price point
1183,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."
1184,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Both my 2 year old and my 4 year old love this tablet!
1185,Health & Beauty,4,Good as advertised and expected.
1186,Electronics,4,My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
1187,Health & Beauty,5,They are great for what I use them for!!
1188,Health & Beauty,1,"Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me."
1189,Electronics,3,I bought 2 for my kids and got a great discount but the one my daughter uses has gave us a little trouble from the start
1190,Health & Beauty,5,they work great!!!!!
1191,Health & Beauty,4,"Nothing really special, but they work just fine and aren't too expensive."
1192,Health & Beauty,1,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well"
1193,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
1194,Electronics,4,"I wanted something bigger than my phone for reading. I was looking at the kindle fire, and the regular kindle e-readers. I liked the paperwhite and voyager, but they didn't have the ability to play audiobooks. I decided to go with the fire because even though it will be mostly used for reading, I can do many other things with it for a cheaper price."
1195,Health & Beauty,4,Good quality batteries at a reasonable price.
1196,Electronics,4,Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
1197,Health & Beauty,4,Very good and just as good as named products.
1198,Electronics,4,Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
1199,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries so far. Great price and well worth the money
1200,Electronics,4,No issues at all... wish it were water proof. My kids and family love it.
1201,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
1202,Electronics,3,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
1203,Health & Beauty,5,AAA!!!
1204,Health & Beauty,1,Tore within one week and is baby blue and very shear not green.
1205,Electronics,4,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
1206,Electronics,4,The only complaint is that you get a year free of Amazon free time but after that first year you start getting charged till you cancel.
1207,Electronics,4,Simple to operate for a 3 yr old . Would recommend
1208,Electronics,4,I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
1209,Health & Beauty,5,"Best value on batteries yet and surprisingly long lasting, high quality batteries by Amazon. Will buy more when needed."
1210,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This is a great product for keeping our 2 year old entertained . She no longer asks for our phones which is a big bonus !
1211,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent product!
1212,Health & Beauty,5,These are just as good as any other battery as far as I can tell but cost far less. Great option if you use lots of batteries! Tired of the store ripping me off when I need a couple.
1213,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
1214,Health & Beauty,5,"Good, cheap, batteries."
1215,Electronics,4,I bought this item as a gift for a relative in her mid teens and so far no complaints.
1216,Health & Beauty,5,"good, inexpensive batteiries"
1217,Health & Beauty,2,Charge doesnt last
1218,Electronics,4,This item is a budget friendly gift for readers and internet browsers!
1219,Health & Beauty,5,"The Internet of Things... more like, Internet of Batteries! The more smart gear we get, the more batteries we blow through. When my wifi-enabled scale (!) pooped out after about 9 months on the factory batteries, I restocked it with the Amazon Basics. They ship in a compact, no-frills cardboard box... inside a larger Amazon shipping box. The cardboard box is easy to open... no screwing around with scissors and sharp plastic packaging. Then you can close the lid on them when done and not worry about them rolling everywhere. If you have shaky hands or poor eyesight, these are the ones to get."
1220,Health & Beauty,5,It's barreries
1221,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever. After m Duracell's in my wireless alarm keypad died after over a year I thought I would try these Amazon batteries. These batteries DO NOT last a week before they die and I have to replace them. Spend the extra money and buy the Duracell's they will same you money in the long run.
1222,Health & Beauty,5,Came as expected
1223,Health & Beauty,4,good product fair price
1224,Electronics,4,I had an older Kindle but it got a virus. The only thing I have against this one is that it gets very hot. Best Buy did not carry covers for it.
1225,Health & Beauty,5,Worked fine for me. Good charge
1226,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent Batteries
1227,Electronics,4,"very pleased with my amazon tablet. starting with the price ,ease of use, and size."
1228,Health & Beauty,4,Good price and long lasting
1229,Health & Beauty,5,No complaints
1230,Health & Beauty,5,"They are great, and great value. I buy them every year for my Christmas needs."
1231,Health & Beauty,4,Great price on a value pack. Battery life is OK. Use for Wii remotes. Lasts long enough for your moneys worth.
1232,Electronics,4,He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
1233,Health & Beauty,1,terrible
1234,Health & Beauty,5,"Super batteries, they last long. Package has so many units that I'm sharing with family and friends. If it's Amazon you know is good."
1235,Health & Beauty,1,All but about 4 were duds. What a waste of money.
1236,Electronics,4,I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
1237,Electronics,3,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
1238,Electronics,3,"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
1239,Health & Beauty,5,Nice flat packaging. They work for a long time.
1240,Health & Beauty,4,"They work we... Maybe don't last as long as the high dollar batteries, but the price makes up for that."
1241,Health & Beauty,5,good price
1242,Health & Beauty,1,There is no place to contact seller THESE batteries are the worst ! The last two days to a week. I would like a refund!
1243,Health & Beauty,5,Works great and are very cost effective. I stock pile these and refill as needed.
1244,Electronics,4,"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
1245,Health & Beauty,4,As Advertised
1246,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries were expired dead when they arrived at my house. I was very disappointed.
1247,Electronics,3,I bought this as a Christmas gift. I'm told that they are enjoying it and are very Happy with all it can do.
1248,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for all the batteries!
1249,Electronics,4,I got this tablet on a deal and has good quality of video you can watch.
1250,Health & Beauty,3,They don't really last that long.. I had them in my mouse I blew through them really quickly. I wouldn't buy them again.
1251,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries work and last good.
1252,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
1253,Health & Beauty,2,More then half don't work
1254,Electronics,4,I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
1255,Health & Beauty,5,ok
1256,Electronics,4,Bought for my son and he enjoys playing in it. He's able to download all the apps he wanted and the camera is awesome.
1257,Electronics,4,Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
1258,Electronics,4,Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
1259,Health & Beauty,5,Never purchased these before ... Work well so far
1260,Health & Beauty,3,ok
1261,Health & Beauty,5,works as advertised
1262,Electronics,4,Was recommended to purchase by a family member who has one who is very happy with it
1263,Health & Beauty,1,"I was excited about the prices of these batteries, however you get what you pay for. These batteries are awful. I've used them in toys, remotes, and flashlights. The remote lasted for like a week! I used the flashlight for a few minutes and that's all the use I got out of them. I unsubscribed to this item. No thanks."
1264,Health & Beauty,5,Works better than the big name brands
1265,Health & Beauty,5,Very good batteries long lasting
1266,Electronics,4,"Practical table, slow, but enough to do essential things, replace a kindle reader to read by a cheapest price $29"
1267,Health & Beauty,2,They didn't last as long as say Duracell..in my opinion.
1268,Electronics,4,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
1269,Health & Beauty,1,Theses did not work. Wanted to make sure I had batteries for the item I was purchasing but they did not work. I had to dig some out of my junk drawer.
1270,Electronics,4,"For being such a small, affordable tablet, it has all the features and apps you need plus perfect size for reading books. And the best part part is it fits in almost any purse!"
1271,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
1272,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal!
1273,Electronics,4,I gave this as a gift to a teenager. She uses it mostly for facebook and to play some games. It works fine for her. She had another smaller version of this fire that only lasted a year. I hope that this one will out last that one!!
1274,Electronics,4,"Christmas gift so it's to early to tell, arrived on time"
1275,Electronics,3,"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better"
1276,Health & Beauty,2,"Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands."
1277,Health & Beauty,3,The batteries are a good price but I am not sure how charged they are. They seem to run out faster than other batteries that I have used.
1278,Health & Beauty,4,good value and packaged well. No issues with these batteries.
1279,Health & Beauty,4,Too soon to tell
1280,Health & Beauty,2,Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
1281,Electronics,4,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
1282,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
1283,Electronics,4,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
1284,Electronics,3,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
1285,Electronics,4,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
1286,Electronics,4,Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
1287,Electronics,4,It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
1288,Electronics,4,"I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
1289,Electronics,4,I bought this item in a good deal and i am loving it. It does what it say.
1290,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
1291,Health & Beauty,3,Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.
1292,Health & Beauty,5,ive not had any problame with these batteries have ordered them in the past been very pleased.
1293,Health & Beauty,1,These run outmuch quicker than the Rayovac Ultra and cost the same...
1294,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the cost
1295,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for a low price.
1296,Electronics,4,"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
1297,Health & Beauty,3,Just ok
1298,Electronics,4,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
1299,Electronics,4,I am very happy with my product. It's nice fancy HD is very cool. I am able to see and read my books in full format now. Thank you.
1300,Health & Beauty,5,The 48 packs are the lowest price per AA battery you will find anywhere. I have a device I use for work that needs 8 new AA batteries every working day. These batteries get me through a 12 hour day the same as the expensive batteries. I could switch to rechargeable batteries but the simplicity of just putting in new batteries and not fooling with recharging every night is worth it to me.
1301,Health & Beauty,4,"I purchased these a little while back. We go through batteries pretty fast in my house and I think that these are just as good as most batteries that I am willing to pay for. The price was right and that is the biggest factor for me when it comes to choosing batteries.I would recommend these to others, but at the same time.. if you are used to duracell batteries or another popular brand, these may not be right for you. You may consider buying them and comparing them directly to duracell and determining if the cost effectiveness is better with these or the duracell.Hopefully this helps you to make an informed decision. I will continue to buy these batteries myself.I would give it a 5 star review if the batteries lasted a bit longer."
1302,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
1303,Electronics,3,Great device I use it on a regular basis. good investment
1304,Electronics,4,I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
1305,Health & Beauty,5,Strong batteries!
1306,Health & Beauty,5,I have purchased Amazon batteries before and they last as long as the leading brands like Energizer or Duracell's for 3x less the cost. Most people nowadays are using rechargeable but there are a few things that still require Alkaline such as my temp signal transmitter for my digital clocks and a pair of these lasted about 9 months out in weather. Other brands died within a few months. You will not be disappointed.
1307,Health & Beauty,5,Just as good as the name kind
1308,Health & Beauty,4,It's what you would expect from a good battery. Really not a lot to say. Expiration date was good. Another dependable Amazon product!
1309,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries do not last at all. Worth just getting energizer batteries instead.
1310,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Overall good tablet for kids. My 6 and 3 year olds both enjoy it. Battery doesn't last anywhere near 7 hours though.
1311,Health & Beauty,1,"Batteries were horrible. As soon as I would put a pair in my Amazon Fire stick remote, I'd get a message that batteries were low. After a day or 2 I couldn't even wake the Fire stick up because the batteries were dead. Went through the hole pack in 2 weeks."
1312,Health & Beauty,5,"These work great. Inexpensive, and from a name you can trust!"
1313,Electronics,4,"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
1314,Electronics,4,Love the sound that comes out and Alexa is very informative!
1315,Health & Beauty,1,Horrible batteries. So far every battery we have used hasn't worked!!!
1316,Health & Beauty,1,The capacity is suspect. I seem to have gotten a lot more out of Energizer.
1317,Health & Beauty,4,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
1318,Health & Beauty,1,This is not what I received.
1319,Health & Beauty,1,Amazon brand batteries are very poor quality. Don't last more than 3 months in a remote control (which barely uses any power). This is shameful and stupid as it diminishes confidence in the Amazon brand name.
1320,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Crystal clear display. Two finger operation took some getting used to. Kept all my settings from previous model. Books already purchased were still available.
1321,Health & Beauty,2,"These batteries drain quickly. While you get a lot of them, the quality just isn't there. If you need reliable batteries, look elsewhere."
1322,Electronics,4,I bought the cover for the tablet as well and I'm very happy with the product.
1323,Health & Beauty,5,"it's batteries, what do you want me to say"
1324,Electronics,4,"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
1325,Health & Beauty,4,I have no qualms about the quality of these batteries.I only wish that every 4 batteries were not individually wrapped.
1326,Electronics,4,"Inexpensive, but well built. Easy navigation. Streams movies well. Sound is decent, but requires headphones generally. Screen is good size and clear. Finding a case for this model is a challenge - I found on-line, but expensive considering tablet price. Universal cases don't work due to button placement."
1327,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries die very quickly. Spend the extra for better batteries.
1328,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
1329,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries at a good price.
1330,Health & Beauty,3,sticking to longer life energizers
1331,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal quality product
1332,Electronics,4,"I needed a reasonable laptop bag and got this.On arrival I put my dell Inspiron laptop inside and the charger went in the front pocket. Inside the laptop slips in the middle then your are able to put a ipad and maybe a diary either side. As there is a slide pocket each side of the laptop.It's actually well made surprisingly and the handles on top are nice and comfortable to use/hold.The strap that goes over the should is nice, maybe could of had more padding on the shoulder strap.The reason for 4 stars is that I think the case should have more padding to protect your electrical device.It's a very nice bag and I do recommend it and for the price it is great."
1333,Electronics,2,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
1334,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It needs the Internet to connect to your devices and play music. Sometimes you can be cut off. The rest of the time it is easy as can be.
1335,Health & Beauty,5,good batteries
1336,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
1337,Electronics,4,The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
1338,Health & Beauty,2,they are cheep so i guess you get what you pay for. i use them in my kids toys and they don't last long.
1339,Electronics,1,I spent more time trying get it functioning than I did actually keeping this product. After a couple of days and never getting it to understand or follow my commands I returned it to BB. Also it kept trying to sell me products which I really didn‚Äôt appreciate.
1340,Electronics,4,Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
1341,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal and good performance batteries. I've bought these in several sizes now.
1342,Health & Beauty,1,Basic performance didnt last a week in an AM radio.
1343,Electronics,2,"Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home."
1344,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and very fast delivery.Update: These batteries did not seem to last as long as other batteries I have used.
1345,Health & Beauty,5,Always in need of batteries
1346,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, and I'm very pleased with performance."
1347,Electronics,4,"I love the Amazon fire. It is very user friendly. It's great for reading books, streaming music, and watching movies."
1348,Health & Beauty,5,Great product with a fast shipping!!!!!
1349,Electronics,4,Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
1350,Health & Beauty,2,I have to admit I was not too happy with these and probably won't buy them again. The 'life' on them is extremely short and definitely leave a lot to be desired.
1351,Health & Beauty,5,AOK
1352,Electronics,3,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
1353,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
1354,Health & Beauty,4,They look.like batteries work like batteries but does anyone ever measure how long they work Seem good to me like.most Amazon products
1355,Electronics,3,"Great value for the money. However, the operating system is a bit clunky. Constant notifications and messages to delete. Some can be turned off, other seem to just keep appearing. The reader app surprisingly is less than intuitive."
1356,Electronics,4,Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves it. Great music player with all the great Alexa capabilities. Opted for the Tap because I'm a bit weary of the Echo always listening.
1357,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
1358,"Office Supplies,Electronics",2,it would not load my books proper. took a dozen tries erasing an dreregistering. screen too dark
1359,Health & Beauty,4,"Well, these are basic, average, ordinary non-rechargeable AA batteries. You get 100 in bundles of 4 tightly wrapped in plastic, all packaged in a plain corrugated cardboard box. The price is good. The batteries are plentiful. I've read reviewer complaints here that the battery quality is inferior, that they don't work, or explode, or ooze, or don't last very long. I can't tell you about this. I don't have a battery tester and nor do I have the ambition to set up a test involving these vs. some top brands to see which work better and last longer.Don't try to charge them (duh!) and just use them. I'm not a big user of AA batteries and now that the World As I Knew It is coming to an end, there will probably be plenty of these still in my house when that end arrives."
1360,Electronics,4,I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
1361,Electronics,1,I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
1362,Health & Beauty,5,"These batteries are the bomb. They work just as well as top brands (Energizer, Duracell) and are like half the price. They shipped super fast and there are so many that I still have some lying around from my order last year. Definitely will re-order when I run out. :)"
1363,Electronics,4,was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
1364,Health & Beauty,5,Such a good deal.
1365,Electronics,4,So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
1366,Electronics,4,My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
1367,Electronics,4,We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
1368,Health & Beauty,1,It's seems as thought all of the batteries in the package are already dead. They are only lasting 3-4 days in the devices I'm putting them in. Fairly disappointed
1369,Health & Beauty,5,Great Buy!
1370,Health & Beauty,5,They lasted much longer than most of the other name brand batteries.
1371,Health & Beauty,5,"They seem to be holding up just as well as the top battery brands, for a fraction of the cost! Another great product from AmazonBasics-I will be hunting for their other products now!"
1372,Health & Beauty,4,All my remotes have new batteries
1373,Electronics,3,my kids have this. it works okay for things like youtube or netflix. Apps take longer to load and many games that you can get for the iPad aren't available on the Fire Tablet. Still say go with Mac.
1374,Electronics,4,and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
1375,Health & Beauty,5,there's a lot and they work. what else can I say except they got here fast.
1376,Electronics,1,The screen breaks way to easy it drop one time broke
1377,Health & Beauty,4,Good value compared to other national brand equivalents
1378,Health & Beauty,5,I Love this!!!!
1379,Electronics,4,"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick."
1380,Electronics,4,"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
1381,Electronics,4,"I bought this Amazon Fire HD 8 purely for personal travel use because I dont like to bring my laptop in case if I lose my laptop! This Amazon Fire is cheap enough that if I lose it during personal travel, I don't care & I will just buy another one. This is my first Amazon Fire. So far, I am happy because the screen is big enough during internet surfing that I can see a whole lot better than my 4"" cell phone. If I could ""re-do"" my purchase, I should have purchased the Amazon Fire 7. Both Fire 7 & HD 8 fit in my side pants' pocket, but HD 8 is a bit bigger & thus heavier. When I looked at both Fire 7 & HD 8 in the Best Buy store, they were not connected to wi-fi. So I purchased HD 8. And, I will keep HD 8. I dont think it would be right for me to return it to BB to exchange for 7 because I already opened the package. Overall, I am happy with Fire HD 8."
1382,Health & Beauty,4,Seems great. Not sure long lasting life is good.
1383,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This product is very good for little kids to keep some very entertained. Occasionally
1384,Health & Beauty,4,"They seem to work well. I've only used three of the pack thus far, but that item is still going strong."
1385,Electronics,4,This is great for kids and for the price. However they don‚Äôt last that long. If you know that ahead of time you won‚Äôt be disappointed
1386,Electronics,4,"pretty convenient to have another cable to charge the kindle,, great price and ready to have it on hand"
1387,Health & Beauty,5,"Just batteries. Nothing was wrong - it's nice to have so many batteries at home for this price, that's it."
1388,Health & Beauty,2,It doesn't work with my Amazon wireless mouse
1389,Health & Beauty,4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"
1390,Health & Beauty,5,Seems good
1391,Electronics,3,"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well."
1392,Electronics,3,Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.
1393,Health & Beauty,5,for an amazon battery they have actually lasted very long.
1394,Health & Beauty,5,Came quickly and I am pleased with the product.
1395,Electronics,4,Bought for reading Kindle books. Large selection of books.
1396,Electronics,4,if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
1397,Electronics,2,Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
1398,Health & Beauty,4,when you use a few items you need a bundle of batteries
1399,Health & Beauty,1,"received the wrapping paper thank you.but no batteries ever came,nor were they in the package with my wrapping paper"
1400,Health & Beauty,1,The package was open and missing two batteries.
1401,Health & Beauty,5,thank you
1402,Health & Beauty,5,Good and cheap.
1403,Electronics,4,Easy to use for kids as a beginner. Plus it's already got a case on it!
1404,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Fire HD8 is a great buy, very inexpensive but delivers great quality. Give a 4 rating and not 5 because there are advertisements on lock screen. Some may welcome the ads others not. Overall this tablet is great. Battery life is several days with very minimal usage. Battery lasts 7 to 12 hours with average usage including video."
1405,Electronics,4,I purchased this as a gift and I'm had I did. This tablet far exceeds my expectations.
1406,Electronics,4,For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
1407,Electronics,4,Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
1408,Electronics,4,I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
1409,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks
1410,Health & Beauty,4,Checking these out. Hope they work about as well as Duracell or Energizer. We'll see. Good price
1411,Electronics,4,Bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Fairly easy for him to use and me to monitor. Definitely recommend the case.
1412,Health & Beauty,4,I've only used four so far so can't give five stars yet. They seem to be working fine but I'm not going to test one to destruction so it will be a feel I get over time.
1413,Electronics,4,"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
1414,Electronics,4,The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
1415,Health & Beauty,5,Good price. Work fine.
1416,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
1417,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon Basics. That's all that needs to be said:)
1418,Electronics,2,When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.
1419,Electronics,4,"I take it everywhere I go. It's got me back into reading again all the time. If you're a first-time kindle buyer like me, you'll enjoy this product. There are problems with installing apps like viber but still a good purchase."
1420,Electronics,4,"Bought for 4yr old, so older kids would stop saying don't touch that. Comes with durable child case. Large enough to see and hold, but small enough to carry. Easy to use and can download favorite stuff."
1421,Electronics,4,Awseome tablet for toddler. I would recommend this tablet for all age groups.
1422,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries seem to work just as well as name brand batteries but at a much cheaper price.
1423,Electronics,4,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
1424,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
1425,Health & Beauty,5,Bought a lot of batteries for Christmas and the AmazonBasics Cell have been good. I haven't noticed a difference between the brand name batteries and the Amazon Basic brand. Just a lot easier to purchase and have arrive at the house and have on hand. Will buy again.
1426,Health & Beauty,3,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."
1427,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My Mistake to buy for 1yr old.But my 30yr old son enjoys it!
1428,Health & Beauty,4,"Seem to last , time will tell will up date later."
1429,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries are great for remotes, but I'm on the fence when it comes to a video game controller. Since I can't say how many actual hours of performance we are getting per use in the controller, I've just noticed that there are more frequent trips to the closet to replace them than usual. Although, it was over the summer and game time was higher than usual."
1430,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Kindle products are easy to use and set up. It does most everything the expensive tablets do.
1431,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.
1432,Electronics,4,Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
1433,Health & Beauty,5,"Everyone discusses the pros and cons of batteries. They lasted 1.2 hours less than brand A or .34 hours longer than brand B.Whatever. They're necessary. They're cheaper than some, more expensive than some. if you're buying 300 batteries a week.......Blah blah..... I have these in my flashlights. I have lots of flashlights. I don't have to go to the store. More than enough for a positive rating."
1434,Health & Beauty,1,don't last long. Replace batteries in my clock almost every 2 months.
1435,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my 7 year old when her Samsung tablet stopped charging. I love the design. Only problem so far is that it randomly freezes and sometimes the volume button won't respond. Other than that, great for the price."
1436,Health & Beauty,5,"No complaints, simply put they are batteries."
1437,Electronics,4,I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
1438,Health & Beauty,2,"Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them."
1439,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
1440,Health & Beauty,4,not even sure if the price and quantity you get are just as comparable than other leading brands. these seem not to hold a long lasting charge
1441,Electronics,4,Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
1442,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I have 3 autistic kids and is great cause they can be rough .
1443,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Works well and fully functional. I would recommend.
1444,Health & Beauty,4,lasts just as long as duracell
1445,Electronics,1,"I have never had so many issues with a kindle and I have purchased alot. It's slow. It shuts off whenever it wants, the sd card dosent read half the time. And when it does it seems to be downloading it. And it deleted apps off my other kids kindle or adds when I do ... very very stupid . It has cracked . And I have never dropped it . It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE"
1446,"Electronics,Media",4,"The touch control, page change controls, are a little to sensitive. Web browser ""too"" experimental."
1447,Electronics,4,"Thoughts of being able to have the Echo ""grow"" as I added to the list of tasks, excited me. Including the latest app, having it to recognize my smartphone's contact list to place and to receive calls. However, the Echo I purchased does not link up to my Samsung smartphone. Disappointed is a understatement."
1448,Electronics,4,Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
1449,Health & Beauty,5,Works great and as good as more expensive brands for a heck of a lot better price/
1450,Electronics,4,"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
1451,Health & Beauty,4,"I'm impressed worth the life of these batteries, still going strong after printing 3 cartridges worth of labels on my dymo labeler."
1452,Health & Beauty,4,"Well made and work very well, so why pay NAME BRAND prices I shall buy these again!"
1453,Health & Beauty,5,We like them
1454,Electronics,4,"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
1455,Health & Beauty,5,"It's not a high discharge battery, but for typical uses such wireless mouse and flashlights, these are great."
1456,Health & Beauty,1,Very poor batteries. I ordered a box and so far about 50 are either bad out of the box or very soon after.
1457,Health & Beauty,2,Dont seem to last very long
1458,Health & Beauty,2,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
1459,Health & Beauty,4,not bad for price
1460,Electronics,4,This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
1461,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are fairly priced for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery."
1462,Electronics,1,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
1463,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I'm an optimist, and I tend to give 5 Star reviews more than anything. Which I've had people make a comment about that. However, I cannot give a 5-star review on this because it's such a simple unit, and with technology these days it should not be as expensive as it is. That being said, the display will blow your mind, it looks like real paper. I highly recommend."
1464,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent for the price. I usually buy Duracell for the guys and their video game controllers -- these last just as long and saved us some .. came in a box that was great for storage and batteries were also vacuum packed by 4's inside the cardboard box. Will buy again
1465,Electronics,4,"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
1466,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
1467,Electronics,4,I couldn't get the tablet to work with my WiFi so I returned it and bought a Samsung A-8.
1468,Electronics,4,Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
1469,Health & Beauty,5,As expected.
1470,Health & Beauty,1,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
1471,Health & Beauty,5,good
1472,Electronics,2,Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
1473,Health & Beauty,4,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
1474,Electronics,4,"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
1475,Health & Beauty,4,Seem O.K.Jim G
1476,Health & Beauty,5,they look good and a great value
1477,Health & Beauty,3,These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.
1478,Electronics,3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
1479,Health & Beauty,4,good value and time will tell if they last as long as duracell
1480,Electronics,4,Very nice and easy to use and the kindle is great.
1481,Electronics,3,"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
1482,Electronics,2,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
1483,Electronics,4,"This table is great for social media like facebook, check emails, watch YouTube , and in general good enough for the price!"
1484,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, great batteries"
1485,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good. Still going. Time will tell. Good price
1486,Health & Beauty,1,Substandard...Dollar store batteries last longer
1487,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for great batteries.
1488,Electronics,4,Purchased one for my older son last year....Got this second d one for the younger one so they don't fight over them.
1489,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries. They work.
1490,Health & Beauty,5,like it for the money
1491,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
1492,Health & Beauty,5,works good!
1493,Electronics,4,"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
1494,Electronics,4,"Purchased this as a child's tablet and I couldn't be happier! I was buying it thinking that it would be cut-rate but ok for a small child to play with on long car rides and on rainy days. Despite the low cost and unimpressive stats I have been very surprised by the quality. The screen is perfectly adequate for games and kids shows, the parental controls/child profile settings are excellent and the stereo speakers CRUSH the built in speakers on my iPad Air 2. The only drawbacks I have found so far are power related. The battery seems to drain fairly quickly under what I would consider normal use and the included charger (typical usb type) takes a very very long time to fully charge the tablet. I suspect this is the charger's limitation rather than the tablet's and it may charge better with a different power supply.I wish that I had purchased two of these tablets at the price they were for sale and I would have kept the second for my own use when on the road."
1495,Electronics,1,Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
1496,Health & Beauty,5,"my mouse and noise cancelling headphones eat this like candy, probably should use the off button more times"
1497,Electronics,4,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
1498,Health & Beauty,5,"These are an amazing product for the price. We use a battery operated sound machine for our son to sleep to, and these work just as long as the Duracell batteries we were originally using and I love that they come in 4 packs within the box, which is extremely convenient so we don't have batteries floating around once they fall out of the box."
1499,Electronics,4,"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
1500,Electronics,4,"My daughter loves it, except that she can't connect to her chromecast"
1501,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the price.
1502,Health & Beauty,4,ok
1503,Health & Beauty,5,works.
1504,Electronics,3,"BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)"
1505,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work fone for a fraction of the price!
1506,Health & Beauty,5,Will only buy amazon basics batteries from now on. Last just as long as the more expensive ones.
1507,Electronics,4,My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
1508,Health & Beauty,3,Not quite the performance I would expect from a product that Amazon puts it's name on. A bit dissapointed.
1509,Electronics,4,My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
1510,Health & Beauty,5,very useful and inexpensive
1511,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing quality and performance for the price. We only buy Amazon batteries now.
1512,Electronics,3,Not many apps. The first one was already returned...no power issue after 1week..I hope the second one is fine...
1513,Health & Beauty,5,does what they are supposed to do.
1514,Electronics,4,This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
1515,Health & Beauty,3,"Nothing special, just alkaline disposable AA batteries at fair price."
1516,Electronics,3,"Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it."
1517,Health & Beauty,5,Second time I bought this- great deal.
1518,Health & Beauty,4,In clocks and light load these batteries work good. In something that draws more power like a hand-held labeler they do not live long
1519,Health & Beauty,4,Just fine - good value
1520,Health & Beauty,4,"I don't know if they are the best or not but they work, and are cheaper."
1521,Health & Beauty,5,Very satisfied
1522,Electronics,3,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
1523,Electronics,4,Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
1524,Electronics,3,Easy to use and lots of handy features. Downside is the ads that apparently can't be shut off and you can't upload and and play downloaded YouTube videos unless you are online.
1525,Electronics,4,"Very easy to use for our seven year old. Will probably upgrade in a year to something with more capabilities and more memory. She had an iPad (lost it) and misses that, but this is the compromise until we see more responsibility in how it's treated. Seems durable thus far."
1526,Electronics,3,This tablet is sufficient for secondary use. At times searches are slow and memory is limited.
1527,Electronics,4,I love the fact that it can take a lick and keeping on ticking my grandson is a bit rough on things.
1528,Electronics,4,Has what is necessary for the average individuals needs.
1529,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,There is no way to lock the font size and it changes if you touch the screen. I liked my paper white better but it died.
1530,Health & Beauty,2,"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
1531,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries lasted a long time for a good price.
1532,Health & Beauty,3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
1533,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries, great price. Gotta love Amazon!"
1534,Health & Beauty,4,"Excellent, cheap product."
1535,Health & Beauty,1,These go dead very quickly. Not worth it if you rely on whatever the batteries are powering. Maybe ok for a remote control or something unimportant.
1536,Electronics,3,I purchased this item for my 7yr old daughter. We like it but we can't get the pictures of the apps to show
1537,Health & Beauty,3,love it
1538,Electronics,4,Much better than my older Kindel. This is my third Kindel. They just keep getting better.
1539,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
1540,Health & Beauty,3,Does not have same charge as top brands. Caveat emptor.
1541,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, good delivery."
1542,Electronics,4,Purchased for a family member. They love it. Would Recommend.
1543,Health & Beauty,5,Good quality good price !
1544,Health & Beauty,5,much better than buying at the grocery store and the last longer.
1545,Electronics,4,Good customer service during my quest to get a good deal and quality gadget.
1546,Health & Beauty,3,They're batteries. They work.
1547,Health & Beauty,1,"batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month"
1548,Electronics,4,Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
1549,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries work good. Nice to have a bunch around for the kids toys.
1550,Health & Beauty,4,Great for the price.
1551,Electronics,4,Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
1552,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Very slow performance and sometimes applications freeze up and don't work very well , charging port very low quality"
1553,Electronics,4,It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
1554,Health & Beauty,4,Good Batteries
1555,Health & Beauty,4,"For some reason I thought I was buying rechargeable ones as these showed up in the results when I typed in rechargeable AAA batteries in the search box. Must not have paid too much attention, oh well. They work as well as the so called high end long lasting brands and I'm still glad that I have them, as it's nice to have extras on hand."
1556,Electronics,4,.Great resolution. Camera quality not so good tho. Gave it one less star for the camera. But overall its a great tablet
1557,"Electronics,Media",4,I love this so far only downside is you can not read and listen at the same time. Its one or the other. Battery life is poor. 50% drained on stanby in under a week. Lasts better if you keep wifi bluetooth off
1558,Electronics,4,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
1559,Health & Beauty,4,"So far so good, they seem to last pretty long."
1560,"Electronics,Media",1,This is not an upgrade by any means! My three year old kindle outperformed Oasis.Battery life better than a week with the lights on lowest setting Magnetic connector is poorly designed and grows weak Two pieces to keep up with
1561,Electronics,4,"this is a very good product, the speakers are good, the price was right. I liked everything about it, other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it, unlike the echo and the dot. The portability was good, but I didn't have much use for it being portable. Unless you are going to keep the Tap within arm's reach, you're better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products. recommended with caveats"
1562,Health & Beauty,5,Lots of very good batteries for not a whole lot of dough.
1563,Health & Beauty,5,"awesome price for decent batteries. they hold up fairly well, haven't run them through any rigorous tests, but when I put them in the remote control it seems to work again."
1564,Electronics,2,"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
1565,Health & Beauty,3,Mediocre performance
1566,Health & Beauty,3,Goof
1567,Health & Beauty,5,Great price!
1568,Electronics,4,"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
1569,Electronics,4,"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
1570,Electronics,4,My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
1571,Electronics,1,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
1572,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries at a lower cost per battery than main stream manufacturers. Highly recommend giving them a try!
1573,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries. Standard AA kind. We use them everyday. They power many things and these work as good or better than any others.
1574,Electronics,4,"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
1575,Electronics,4,Amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far...The only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don't have to tap every command....That would make it a 5star device....
1576,Electronics,4,"Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!"
1577,Health & Beauty,3,Good price. Have used in my TV remote and had to change batteries after2 months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Get what you pay for.
1578,Health & Beauty,4,Was as advertised
1579,Health & Beauty,1,did order or get
1580,Electronics,4,I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
1581,Electronics,4,I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
1582,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,This is more a no-frills Kindle compared to the ones that had keyboards and nicer back-lit features. But it does the job. Make sure to get it on sale.
1583,Electronics,4,"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap."
1584,Electronics,2,Wasnt really impressed with the operating system. Was hoping it was more of android style. Not so much.
1585,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good.
1586,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal in town.
1587,Health & Beauty,5,"These batteries are a great deal! The price is very reasonable and the life of the batteries are just as good as any major brand. Now that I have tried these out, I will purchase the amazon brand for all my future battery needs."
1588,Electronics,4,Slower that my iPad. Love it. Cheaper and better than my Kindle Paperwhite with much more storage. Also bought 128 micro SD card. Prime member and use it to download free with prime movies
1589,Health & Beauty,1,Do not leave these batteries sitting on a dresser... or pretty much anywhere you don't want battery acid leaked onto. We took the batteries out of our remote at night and woke up to our brand new 3500 dresser ruined. Awesome.
1590,Health & Beauty,1,"This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long."
1591,Electronics,4,"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
1592,Health & Beauty,5,Great Price
1593,Health & Beauty,3,Ok
1594,Health & Beauty,4,"Seem to last as long as the well known brands for a lower price, I will purchase again"
1595,Electronics,4,"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
1596,Electronics,4,It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
1597,Health & Beauty,4,"Life of battery varies with individual battery, which was disappointing. Maybe this is the difference between buying the house brand and buying the name brand--quality control."
1598,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Purchased this for my son. Decent tablet but not optimum
1599,Health & Beauty,5,As good as durcell batteries.
1600,Electronics,4,This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
1601,Electronics,1,"Too proprietary, the apps my daughter liked I could not install on it for her so basically it was worthless for me and I returned it."
1602,Health & Beauty,5,Very nice
1603,Electronics,2,"Super slow, not of decent quality.I would not buy another. Memory on it is lacking for 8 gig. I will not recommend it to anyone"
1604,Health & Beauty,4,Work well enough in the small gadgets like remotes and LED flashlights.
1605,Electronics,3,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
1606,Health & Beauty,3,we'll see how they hold up
1607,Electronics,4,Bestbuy is always on top of any other brands interms of offer and quality of product as always
1608,Electronics,4,"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
1609,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
1610,Electronics,4,"Overall I've been very happy with my new Kindle Voyage, the screen is much sharper than my wife's paperwhite (v1) and the backlight is much more even. I've also been very happy with the page turn buttons. It makes it significantly more convenient to turn pages than using the screen and the pressure and feedback both seem about right. The only issue I have that keeps this from earning 5 stars is that the backlight on the screen has a slightly two-tone hue. It is somewhat yellowish on top and bluish on the bottom of the screen. It isn't something that really distracts from reading but it is noticeable when looking for it. Fix this so the coloring is even and it is really a perfect ereader."
1611,Health & Beauty,5,"I don't have any little kids , however the big boys seem to ear these batteries just as quickly. Price was great. Satisfied our' needs."
1612,Health & Beauty,3,"Nice value, average life."
1613,Electronics,2,Just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music I like.
1614,Health & Beauty,4,like
1615,Health & Beauty,5,Lots of fresh batteries at a great price.
1616,Health & Beauty,5,great price
1617,Health & Beauty,2,"Dont last long. I thought because they had the AMAZOn name they would be good, but they are no better than other generic batteries."
1618,Health & Beauty,4,Good performance.
1619,Electronics,1,"We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed."
1620,Electronics,2,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on."
1621,Health & Beauty,5,"I love these batteries from Amazon and will continue to buy them for my controllers for gaming as they are strong enough to deal with them. I get a long life from these. As long as I do from my Duracells! I complete this review after either I or an immediate family member has tested the product thoroughly. Sometimes I have very little to say about a product if it works and it does what it is advertised. Sometimes I wax effusive, or rather poetic. Either way please be assured that we have tested the product and have been honest with you. If my review is helpful for you or makes sense, please indicate Yes below. Thank you for reading my review."
1622,Health & Beauty,5,"These are your standard AA batteries that are very similar to most other AA batteries you will find at most stores. The energy output is quite similar however the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than what you can find in the store. For that reason I really like using these batteries from Amazon Basics. They are cheap and they last an acceptable amount of time for a cheap battery.Dimensions and close-ups can be seen in the photos I have attached to the review.Included in this set are 48 batteries that are shrink wrapped in groups of 4.Pros:*Good amount of power output*Last an acceptable amount of time*Awesome priceCons:*NoneAdditional Considerations:These batteries are not rechargeable. They are one-time use. If you need a rechargeable battery you will need to look elsewhere.Overall: 5/5 stars (.5 rounds up, .5 rounds down) 5 starsIf you have any further questions regarding the product in my review please leave a comment below and I will get back to you as soon as possible."
1623,Health & Beauty,5,works great for me
1624,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning
1625,Health & Beauty,2,They run out of power very quickly.
1626,Electronics,4,"This is by far the best reader for all lighting environments. The only drawback I see are the constant ads when you log on to the device, and the library interfaceneeds to be more intuitive. However, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and use of this Voyage. I've already read over six books with it in just 3+ weeks."
1627,Health & Beauty,5,Great product! Affordable and reliable!
1628,Electronics,4,"Compared to other tablets, the Amazon Kindle Fire is much more affordable, and just as useful as other tablets. THis is a great item and we love it"
1629,Health & Beauty,4,It work
1630,Health & Beauty,4,"Always quality, always on time. Love Amazon's batteries."
1631,Electronics,4,love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
1632,Health & Beauty,5,Good procuct!!
1633,Health & Beauty,4,"Great deal on batteries, I have a baby so lots of things need batteries around here and these are a great deal. I don't think they last quite as long as an energizer or Duracell but they are still comparable."
1634,Electronics,4,"Just decent tablet... working fast, but it needs more language support and apps as well..."
1635,Health & Beauty,5,"On time, product as advertised."
1636,Health & Beauty,5,Happy
1637,Electronics,4,Screen is good . Lack of Google play kinda hurts but you will survive. The issue of back buttons or multifunction buttons is that sometime they don't appear when you need them.. as they are part of the screen . So you have to kinda summons them which is a pain
1638,Electronics,4,I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
1639,Electronics,4,Easy to use even for my 3 yr old happy with how it has a lot of apps that are free same as Android to download. Good deal for the price. My son loves it.
1640,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon basics are pretty good.
1641,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD. INEXPENSIVE. LONG LASTING WE'LL SEE.
1642,Electronics,4,I was using this for a while it was 10X faster then my kindle 5th generation yes 1gb of ram but the App Store made from Amazon is not the best so I downloaded the google play store to get the apps I mostly used I only use my kindle fire had 8 for books and reading or watching YouTube or the web I'm giving the rating 4 stars
1643,Health & Beauty,5,"I don't know, I bought them for someone else."
1644,Electronics,4,A great alternative to the more expensive iPad. I prefer my paper white for reading but this is great for everything else.
1645,Electronics,4,I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
1646,Electronics,4,Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
1647,Electronics,4,Very easy to use by a 2 year old. Love how I can limit the time use.
1648,Health & Beauty,3,Just regular AA batteries at a decent price.
1649,Health & Beauty,3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
1650,Health & Beauty,3,I don't feel like they last as long as the name brand batteries.
1651,Health & Beauty,4,"These Amazon batteries did the job although I gave 4star only because I had a few I would say a hand full of batteries that were not as strong or were pretty weak but out of a box of 48 batteries, I will definitely buy again for this priceIm pretty well satisfied.Thank you!"
1652,Health & Beauty,5,Good value and quality
1653,Health & Beauty,3,"Some work, some don't."
1654,Electronics,4,Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
1655,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"My 5 year old dropped this from a standing position (about a foot off the ground) and it busted. I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids. I'm happy with the apps, but definitely not thrilled with the lack of protection that is designed for kids."
1656,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries seem to die quickly.
1657,Health & Beauty,5,"I got tired of running back and forth to the local store to buy a small package of batteries therefore, I decided to order these since the cost for all of these batteries were approximately the same cost for 6 batteries in a pack. The price was right and the batteries are working very well. This is really a bargain."
1658,Health & Beauty,1,Die way too fast
1659,Electronics,4,I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
1660,Health & Beauty,5,Love them!
1661,Health & Beauty,4,Serves the purpose. Good for the price.
1662,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect and work great
1663,Electronics,4,Great tablet but doesn't charge fast take a while to charge have to remove case to charge and I Brought 3 can be a hassle with kids
1664,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
1665,Health & Beauty,5,so far so good for the price
1666,Health & Beauty,5,It's a whole crap load of Aa batteries. They make electricity happen. It's magic
1667,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
1668,Health & Beauty,4,"The positive contact does not stick out as far as others brands so they may not work in all devices. Just discovered this today.Otherwise, they are good."
1669,Electronics,4,My son loves this product. He plays video games and watch movies on his tablet. We also use it for learning. There are several learning apps you can download on this product.
1670,Health & Beauty,1,"I bought these several months ago. I use them for Xbox One controllers. Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it."
1671,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries so... yeah.
1672,Health & Beauty,2,"Great price, however battery life is not comparable to other brands."
1673,Electronics,4,"Once I understand how to use this, it will be awesome"
1674,Electronics,3,When I finally opened and started the process it took forever to load apps but when it finally finished it was fine
1675,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. Great price. How can you go wrong
1676,Electronics,4,It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
1677,Health & Beauty,3,THEY DON'T LAST AS LONG AS EVEREADY OR DURACEL.
1678,Health & Beauty,5,they're cheap batteries
1679,Electronics,4,Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
1680,Electronics,4,"This tablet with the lesser price tag than a appple ipad is far less worry fora 3 yr old to have and own to watch with you while you both are together on the couch at night, a must for a first time tablet owner who has a young child. Who‚Äôs addicted to your own apple tablet."
1681,Electronics,4,Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
1682,Electronics,4,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
1683,Electronics,4,"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
1684,Electronics,4,"For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
1685,Electronics,4,We bought three including one for my 2 year old. We all love it! The only complaint is the volume. There is one speaker and so the sound is obviously lower than most other tablets with two speakers. It doesn't bother us too much but that's why we give it 4/5 stars. Overall a great tablet.
1686,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I have had 4 other e Readers prior to this one. This one is BY FAR my favorite. It is so easy to use, it is super light, and makes a book worm like me able to read with no effort at all!"
1687,Electronics,4,The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
1688,Electronics,4,This tablet was great. I bought it for my sister on christmas and she loves it. It is great for surfing the web and watching videos.
1689,Health & Beauty,5,Works great! Will buy again when needed.
1690,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
1691,Electronics,4,Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
1692,Electronics,3,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
1693,Electronics,4,I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
1694,Health & Beauty,4,works as expected
1695,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I love the kindle, although do then to drop them. Always get the insurance and best buy makes it easy to replace them"
1696,Electronics,4,"Lost my ""paper white"" in airplane, have to buy new one. Voyage is latest model, I like it. Friend of mine wants one as well with my recommendation, so, bought two. Nice to have them!"
1697,Health & Beauty,1,Many of the batteries are no good.
1698,Health & Beauty,4,Very good batteris
1699,Health & Beauty,5,Why spend more on other brand name batteries when you can get these for a fraction of the price and they work really well.
1700,Health & Beauty,5,"cheap batteries, not much to report"
1701,Health & Beauty,2,Seems like these don't last long at all
1702,Health & Beauty,4,Junk.
1703,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.
1704,Health & Beauty,3,They're just batteries like advertised
1705,Health & Beauty,5,"good price, fast service"
1706,Health & Beauty,5,Just an amazing product how can you go wrong.
1707,Health & Beauty,4,"Good price, well packaged. I have not used them for any real duration yet. They are shrink wrapped. However, unlike the 9 volt batteries, you can twist the package and get through the plastic wrapper."
1708,Electronics,4,This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
1709,Health & Beauty,4,Don't last as long as energizer but a great deal!
1710,Health & Beauty,1,"When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen."
1711,Health & Beauty,1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
1712,Health & Beauty,2,"I used these in a mini led flashlight, which I use to walk my dog every night. I use the flashlight about 20-30 minutes every night and the batteries only last maybe 3 weeks."
1713,Electronics,4,I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
1714,Health & Beauty,4,Last just as long as other less expensive brands.
1715,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for batteries
1716,Electronics,3,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
1717,Electronics,4,"Tends to flip out of my screen to something else. Each screen change = at least one pop up ad. Otherwise, it's been reliable so far."
1718,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and last long.
1719,Electronics,4,"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
1720,Health & Beauty,4,"Second time ordering these and it probably wont be the last. Very impressed with the run time and the price is right (especially if you are a Prime member.) It's been proven to me over many years both by my own research and feedback from customers that when it comes to branded alkaline batteries the differences between Energerzier, Duracell, Radio Shack, Panasonic Ray-O-Vac and Amazon are so negligible as to make price the real deciding factor"
1721,Electronics,4,Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
1722,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,I like the contrast it is easy to read on outside.
1723,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
1724,Health & Beauty,1,batteries didnt even last one month...very dissapointed
1725,Electronics,4,It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
1726,Health & Beauty,5,batteries work awesome
1727,Health & Beauty,5,WORD!!
1728,Electronics,4,Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
1729,Health & Beauty,4,Good price works fine.
1730,Health & Beauty,1,They work but they don't last they drain really quickly only had them about 2 weeks and they are almost all dead. Very frustrating will not be buying these again save your money and buy Duracell.
1731,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This tablet is great for kids, but also for adults who want something they can share with their children. I love the amazon free time on it. You can set time limits for your kids and it helps a lot with limiting time."
1732,Electronics,1,"Everything is locked out to Amazon, no compatibility with the Google Play Store and a lot of games the children play are on the Play Store. This product is bad because it is locked into only Amazon services."
1733,Health & Beauty,5,"Cheap batteries, yo!"
1734,Health & Beauty,5,"great deal, used these to run my trail camera for several months."
1735,Health & Beauty,4,Seemingly sufficient at a good price!
1736,Electronics,4,Good compact size great display stable OS audio is good very limited apps
1737,Health & Beauty,4,"As good as any of the big name brands. Only complaint is the very difficult to remove plastic from each group of four batteries. I appreciate that Amazon is concerned with reducing package size, but wrapping them in plastic isn't working for me. Would have been much better to use a small band to keep them together since they are in a tight cardboard box, it is unlikely they will short each other out, the band probably isn't even needed."
1738,Electronics,3,"3 yr old loves it, I hate it. Hours spent download"
1739,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
1740,Electronics,4,I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
1741,Electronics,4,I bought this for trips as it is smaller than my iPad. It was fine to read books and check my email. The internet was slow and aggravating. I am happy with my purchase.
1742,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
1743,Health & Beauty,2,Half the batteries were dead or low charged out of the box.
1744,Health & Beauty,4,"Great Value Batteries, though I thought it'd last longer"
1745,Electronics,4,"The product works great, just a little on the small side."
1746,Electronics,4,this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
1747,Electronics,4,"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
1748,Electronics,4,the fire tablet is a nice size and is easy to use it is better then the 7in fire
1749,Electronics,4,Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
1750,Health & Beauty,4,Good battery for your money
1751,Health & Beauty,5,the only way to go
1752,Electronics,3,Personally I'd say buy the newer 6 inch fire. But you do get more for your money getting the older one.
1753,Health & Beauty,1,"Bought a, c d 9v batteries in April the AAA seemed fine but went to replace them 4 backs dead. I tried 5th pack and they worked. I will no longer be buying batteries from Amazon you can not count on them. I had d didn't work I hope 9v work. Some of these where for fire alarms not long lasting or don't workUsed c batteries they lasted 12 0f a CD Amazon batteries are horrible"
1754,Health & Beauty,2,"Marginal performance at best. Used one in my Turbo razor, and it died much earlier than other brands. It also dies quickly, with a steep power drop-off."
1755,Health & Beauty,1,These are cheap and they Explode!!!!!! I was pumping at 2am and it exploxed in my pump. It leaked all over my pump and baby blankets!!!!! Ive never had this happen with name brand!!!!! Now I have to find time with a newborn to packed up all the batteries from all our baby items and return!! Not Cool!!
1756,Electronics,4,Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
1757,Health & Beauty,2,BATTERIES have a very SHORT LIFE... WILL NOT RECOMMEND nor BUY AGAIN..
1758,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.
1759,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries don't last very long at all. Save your money. I don't recommend
1760,Health & Beauty,5,awesome
1761,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries. Good stuff.
1762,Electronics,4,Bought this for easier reading and it meets my expectations. Great display fidelity.
1763,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
1764,Health & Beauty,5,Great price.
1765,Health & Beauty,3,Only 32 batteries in the package when advertised as 36.
1766,Electronics,3,Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
1767,Health & Beauty,5,"Have this as a subscribe save item, so when I run out I just order more."
1768,Health & Beauty,5,Batters work well and a great price.
1769,Health & Beauty,5,I think it can has a long life.
1770,Health & Beauty,4,Gifted with Xmas toys.
1771,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon Basics comes through with yet another superb value. These work every bit as well as their Energizer and Duracell equivalents at a fraction of the price. It comes in a nice carton that is perfect for storage and can be recycled when the batteries are gone. Highly recommended!
1772,Electronics,3,NOT REALLY NEEDED. I ALREADY HAD TWO AND DECIDED THREE WAS OVERLY ONE TOO MUCH.
1773,Electronics,3,Too slow for games and videos i bought it for my youngest son so they wouldnt fight for the ipad but they still do
1774,Health & Beauty,5,Good value for price!batteries last just as long as name brand! Will buy again!
1775,Electronics,4,I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
1776,Electronics,4,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
1777,Electronics,4,"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
1778,Electronics,4,"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."
1779,Electronics,3,"I was not a fan of the Amazon type operating system that is on the tablet. Ended up taking it back because it was not what I wanted, not as easy and supportive of games and apps as an Android tablet."
1780,Health & Beauty,2,they need to be change to offen
1781,Electronics,4,Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
1782,Electronics,4,"I thought I wanted a new Kindle, but after shopping around realized this tablet offered me a better viewing screen and many more options."
1783,Electronics,3,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
1784,Health & Beauty,4,"These were super reasonably priced. They last about as long as the dollar store ones, so if you have wall clocks or remotes that need 'em, you're good. If you have high-drain stuff, they'll burn up pretty quick. But it's still cool to have tons of AAs on hand."
1785,Electronics,3,the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
1786,Health & Beauty,4,They work great used all of them in 2 min on all my Kids GEOtrax trains.
1787,Health & Beauty,5,Lotta batteries. at a good price.
1788,Health & Beauty,5,Always great!
1789,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I like the fact that it comes w/a case. It's easy for the child to operate, instructions are clear."
1790,Health & Beauty,4,good for the price
1791,Health & Beauty,5,good
1792,Electronics,4,"If you are looking for an easy-to-use tablet, this Fire 8 delivers! I use it for music while working out and it has many other functions that not many people know about. I like to use it as a second monitor while using my computer and I can monitor my house. Since I do not have a smart phone, this helps me out a lot."
1793,Health & Beauty,3,"This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning."
1794,Health & Beauty,4,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
1795,Electronics,2,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
1796,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries do not last very long at all.
1797,"Electronics,Media",4,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
1798,Health & Beauty,5,Price is very competitive.
1799,Health & Beauty,5,I'll never run out of batteries again! insert sinister mad scientist laugh here
1800,Health & Beauty,5,Good value for the price.
1801,Health & Beauty,4,Work as well or better than name brand. Good lasting power.
1802,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
1803,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,BOUGHT FOR MY GRANDKIDS AGES 5-10 AND THEY LOVED IT
1804,Health & Beauty,1,"They don't last. USed in electronics (like computer mice, computer keyboards) Energizer or Duracell last easily 3x longer. Not worth the savings. If its going in some kids game or infrequent use (where the battery would be dead later anyways) ok."
1805,Electronics,4,"Bought this tablet for my wife and she likes it. She plays a few games, checks her email, and goes on Facebook. High end users would not be satisfied with this tablet but overall an excellent value."
1806,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The product is easy for grandson to operate and navigate through and seems to be very durable
1807,"Office Supplies,Electronics",2,"I love the kindle and have had one in one shape or another since they first came out, but I just could not take how slow this model was. I returned it and purchased a Samsung tablet."
1808,Electronics,4,"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
1809,Health & Beauty,3,"Good price. When new, they tested on the low end of good with my voltmeter. I'll add to my post after I've had a chance to test battery life."
1810,Electronics,4,Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
1811,Health & Beauty,1,"They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas."
1812,Health & Beauty,5,good
1813,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product, they work just as well as brand name batteries."
1814,Health & Beauty,5,A+ Item
1815,Health & Beauty,5,Works as described.
1816,Electronics,3,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
1817,Health & Beauty,5,Good.
1818,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Nice basic reader. Had the first model kindle and this is quite a bit lighter
1819,Health & Beauty,5,No problems.
1820,Health & Beauty,1,They die quickly
1821,Health & Beauty,4,it works just fine. good price.
1822,Electronics,1,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
1823,Electronics,4,Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
1824,Electronics,3,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
1825,Health & Beauty,4,Great product. I always keep them handy to use on kids gaming controls and other miscellaneous items around the house.
1826,Health & Beauty,2,"Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name."
1827,Electronics,3,"Ok tablet from amazon, added Google play to device for more apps. Google how to do this."
1828,Electronics,4,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
1829,Electronics,4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
1830,Electronics,4,"This is the third Kindle Fire in my household, but the first kid's edition. I absolutely love this thing. It's very intuitive if you've ever used another android style device. My 6 year old and 3 year old both have a their own profile, each linked with different movies/games. Setup was pretty easy with choosing preferred content based on characters/themes appropriate for their age group. Moving our Disney and other digital copies of movies was equally easy after signing in. The battery lasts about 4.5 hours before needing a charge, which is plenty for our use. The biggest complaint is that the micro USB connection isn't the best. The cord has a tendency to come loose and stop charging if the device is jostled even the tiniest amount. I've seen this problem with other Kindles as well. This is aa bunch problem if you think that you're charging it overnight only to find out that it stopped when you set it down. It also makes it very difficult to use during a charge. The amazing amount of content that you get from the Amazon library with the included year is nice as well. My 6 year old gets to try a bunch of games that I otherwise wouldn't let him try since I'd have to pay and he most likely get tired of after 5 minutes. Overall, I'd say the best kid tablet out there."
1831,Health & Beauty,5,Love having a stash on batteries
1832,Health & Beauty,5,"Very happy, Great product!"
1833,Health & Beauty,4,Good product for the money
1834,Health & Beauty,5,Love Amazon Batteries. This is the first time I have tried the Performance line. So far so Great :)
1835,Electronics,4,Allows for reading of my Kindle lib and even plays a few games
1836,Electronics,4,Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
1837,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries for a good price. Will buy again.
1838,Health & Beauty,5,Just as great as name-brand batteries! The only difference seems to be the labels.
1839,Health & Beauty,4,does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them
1840,Health & Beauty,3,Ours did not last nearly as long as energizer or Duracell in our sons toys. No real data to prove this other than we went through batteries like they were candy until I restocked with energizer.
1841,Electronics,4,"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
1842,Electronics,4,The only regret I have is that the price went down the week after I purchased it. It is much easier to use than a phone because of it's screen size and it's capabilities.
1843,Health & Beauty,5,Exactly what I was expecting
1844,Health & Beauty,1,run out super quick! would not buy again
1845,Electronics,3,"Great sound, it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs. For example, yesterday I told it to play Mexican music -- didn't know any, same with Mariachi Music. Could not play any, Odd,"
1846,Health & Beauty,2,"Won't buy again, I replaced batteries in my smoke detectors with these less than two months ago, replacing again with Duracell. The last Duracell batteries lasted almost 3 years in the same detectors. Don't waste your money on these, spend a little more for a good product."
1847,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
1848,Electronics,4,"Cons:Isn't compatible with some of my Google apps that I use daily.Does not operate the latest Facebook updates.Camera image quality is poor.Pros:Smooth interface, user friendly.Good battery life.Supports kids' separate profiles so that it may be shared by family members.Easily syncs with other devices."
1849,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
1850,Health & Beauty,5,Great product
1851,Health & Beauty,2,Does not last as long as Duracell quantum. These were sent as a supplement
1852,Health & Beauty,5,Being a gamer I go through batteries quite frequently. I do have rechargeable battery packs but I often forget to plug them in and I am too impatient to wait to play until after they are charged. These batteries have surprised me with how long they last in my XBox 360 Controllers!
1853,Electronics,4,I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
1854,Health & Beauty,3,"When I opened the pack and put them in a device, it already said battery low."
1855,Health & Beauty,4,Thanks
1856,Health & Beauty,5,works great!!!!!
1857,Health & Beauty,5,as advertised
1858,Health & Beauty,5,"Arrived earlier than expected. Amazon batteries are not only affordable, but have a long life."
1859,Health & Beauty,4,Decent quality. Of course Great seller )
1860,Electronics,2,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
1861,Electronics,4,"The price was good for this product, however we have gone through 3 of the previous models with varying issues."
1862,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this for learning and entertaining purposes. My daughter is 5 & enjoys it. I compared this to other learning tablets and found for the price & protection plan this works best for us.
1863,Health & Beauty,3,Does not last as long as name brands such as Duracell and Energizer.
1864,Health & Beauty,5,nice product
1865,Health & Beauty,5,Great for the office
1866,Health & Beauty,5,"Awesome, just as described!"
1867,Health & Beauty,2,I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.
1868,Health & Beauty,5,good quality
1869,Health & Beauty,3,Not really the greatest
1870,Health & Beauty,5,excellent
1871,Health & Beauty,5,nice quality
1872,Electronics,4,I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
1873,Electronics,3,"Good features for kids, but definitely not enough storage. You'll need to get an SD card and set things to download to that or it will freeze and stop working."
1874,Health & Beauty,3,they seem a bit hit-or-miss...had a few kinda crap out pretty quickly (way too quickly) on me when used in my young son's toys
1875,Health & Beauty,3,"Work great in some devices but not some (like some brands of cordless mouse). Still, a good value for many uses."
1876,Health & Beauty,5,BATTERIES! CHEAP!
1877,Electronics,4,"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
1878,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal I have found!
1879,Electronics,4,"My wife has the Samsung tablet and has better access to games. I can't get the same games on my new Amazon Fire, but in general the quality is top notch - the inability to load apps desired is disappointing."
1880,Electronics,4,My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
1881,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
1882,Health & Beauty,5,They work real good and were the right price.
1883,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price package is perfect to store them in, are as good as the brand names!"
1884,"Electronics,Media",4,Kind of disappointed that they did away with the included battery cover and also removed the ability to even connect a battery cover.
1885,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This has a lot of great features for kids and for parents who want to protect them. My kids love having their own.
1886,Health & Beauty,5,THANKS
1887,Health & Beauty,1,Not suitable for toys. Drained within just a couple of days.
1888,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It is easy for little ones to use. Great beginner buy.
1889,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
1890,Health & Beauty,5,Inexpensive but last for a while. Have bought in multiple sizes and will continue to do so!
1891,Health & Beauty,4,Just as good as more expensive batteries.
1892,Health & Beauty,5,Great value.
1893,Health & Beauty,3,don't last as long as the brand name
1894,Electronics,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
1895,Health & Beauty,3,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem
1896,Electronics,4,Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............
1897,Electronics,3,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
1898,Electronics,4,Son loves it and uses it all e time but I wish it would share my audible acct so e would read what I listen to without us having to buy some items in two formats.. Recommended
1899,Electronics,3,"Decent little tablet if you are not a game player. Tablet shuts down and I cant get it back on when I play games for long periods of time. It's not my ipad, that's for sure."
1900,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Perfect device for kids learning how to use touch devices. Great tool for learning.
1901,Health & Beauty,4,great for the price and last as long as other name brand batteries
1902,Health & Beauty,5,great value for the price!
1903,Health & Beauty,4,Good price for these batteries. They seem to be of good quality and the price is right.
1904,Electronics,4,"The commercials are correct, at this price you can have multiple devices in your household for the price of a comparable competitor's tablet."
1905,Electronics,4,Does a lot more than old tablet.It Hasmore memory.
1906,Health & Beauty,4,this works well enough for the price point. I would recommend it if you are on a budget.
1907,Health & Beauty,5,Prompt shipment of quality product.
1908,Health & Beauty,5,Nice to have plenty of batteries around
1909,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries.
1910,Electronics,1,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
1911,Health & Beauty,5,"using them in our trail cam, excellent battery life"
1912,Health & Beauty,3,Jury still out. Only recently used a couple.
1913,Electronics,4,Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
1914,Health & Beauty,4,"Cant see any difference from the more expensive Duracell batteries. Great price. Use them for flashlights clocks, and remote controls."
1915,Health & Beauty,1,I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span. I ended up going through these quickly so I could probably just buy the expensive ones and get the same life rather than keeping on purchasing these.
1916,Health & Beauty,5,Worked fine
1917,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It a great tablet for children. But it doesnt work with google apps.
1918,Health & Beauty,5,cant beat it
1919,Electronics,4,I bought 5 Amazon Fire tablets for Christmas they all loved it! Only problem is I did not get myself one! I got a great deal on Black Friday otherwise no one would have gotten one.
1920,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Got this for my Grandson's birthday. He really wanted a tablet and I wanted something that wasn't so breakable. He was so excited and he loves it
1921,Electronics,4,very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
1922,Electronics,4,Works Great! Love the screen sharpness. Very easy to use.
1923,Electronics,4,"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
1924,Health & Beauty,1,"Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time."
1925,Electronics,3,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
1926,Electronics,1,We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
1927,Electronics,4,I purchased for my daughters birthday. She loves it and spends hours playing her favorite games and looking up info for school.
1928,Health & Beauty,1,"I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money."
1929,Electronics,4,I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
1930,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries at a great price! The packaging is solid so no damage in shipping.
1931,Electronics,4,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
1932,Electronics,4,Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
1933,Electronics,4,I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
1934,Health & Beauty,3,Needed them in a hurry - don't last that long.
1935,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi
1936,Health & Beauty,5,Um it's batteries
1937,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
1938,Health & Beauty,1,these batteries explode - terrible quality
1939,Electronics,4,"Our kids love it and the Amazon unlimited is fantastic with tons of options. However, our kids still fight over usin our grownup tablet bc the screen is larger."
1940,Electronics,4,Good for what I need. Purchased for a Christmas present
1941,Electronics,4,"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
1942,Electronics,4,Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
1943,Electronics,4,Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
1944,Electronics,4,This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
1945,Electronics,4,"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
1946,Health & Beauty,4,Thx
1947,Electronics,4,Looked for a tablet for reading books and light web surfing. This fits that need.
1948,Health & Beauty,4,Work as well as the expensive batteries. What more could we ask for
1949,Health & Beauty,5,A+A+A+A+A+ FAST DELIVERY JUST AS DESCRIBE
1950,Health & Beauty,1,Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.
1951,Health & Beauty,5,good deal
1952,Health & Beauty,4,Great battery and bang for your hard earned dollar!
1953,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good product for a young child to play with without breaking
1954,Health & Beauty,1,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
1955,Health & Beauty,5,Great product at a great price Thank you
1956,Health & Beauty,5,Great value for your money..
1957,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
1958,Health & Beauty,1,"I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days."
1959,Health & Beauty,1,I was excited to see that Amazon was allowing its name to be used on batteries as I feel that Amazon is concerned about its image. Bought these batteries and placed four of them into my camera. Took 2 RAW photos and the batteries are now dead. What a disappointment.
1960,Electronics,4,Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
1961,Health & Beauty,5,keep some in reserve
1962,Electronics,3,It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
1963,Electronics,2,I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.
1964,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries! Inexpensive and last a long time!
1965,Electronics,4,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
1966,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries. They work. Mine came packaged fantastically in this little box. I couldn't want anything more.
1967,Electronics,4,It's pretty cool. Integration with Amazon Music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company.
1968,Health & Beauty,5,Can't beat AmazonBasics.
1969,Electronics,4,"Easy to use. Easy to read. The SILK browser a little slow. Adequate for regular apps.Honestly, I have not maximized its potential."
1970,Electronics,4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
1971,Health & Beauty,5,"Great quality batteries. Comes in a small box, perfect for storing."
1972,Electronics,4,"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
1973,Health & Beauty,5,"These AmazonBasics AA batteries are a phenomenal value for the quality you get! The batteries last quite a long time and they're well worth the price you pay.We go through batteries at my house like they're going out of style, so finding a bulk amount for a reasonable price was a bit difficult. These batteries solved my problem with that. It was a great purchase, and I recommend them for you folks out there that go through batteries quickly. You'll find that to not be the case with these."
1974,Health & Beauty,5,Great valueRight price
1975,Health & Beauty,5,"No complaints, just a normal battery!"
1976,Health & Beauty,5,All around great experience!
1977,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries for the price.
1978,Health & Beauty,3,They don't last as long as a Duracell but they are cheaper.
1979,Electronics,4,Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
1980,Health & Beauty,5,As expected.
1981,Health & Beauty,4,"Great product , great price."
1982,Health & Beauty,3,"these are not comparable to Duracell, but it's cheap"
1983,Health & Beauty,5,Came as advertised. Batteries seem to last pretty long and the price was great. Even the paging they sent it in was greatPlease Vote YES on my review!! Thank you
1984,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I bought this for my two year old grandson but the restrictions were too much.
1985,Health & Beauty,5,better than buying 12 duracell betters for the same price. Used primarily for my kids toys.
1986,Health & Beauty,5,They seem to do as well as most.
1987,Electronics,3,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
1988,Electronics,3,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
1989,Health & Beauty,5,Battery last long!
1990,Health & Beauty,5,"They work great and come in excellent packaging!I can't vouch for their lifespan vs the big brands, since I haven't paid attention to how long my old batteries would last. It's at least comparable! Comparable enough that the discount on AmazonBasics batteries is definitely worthwhile!"
1991,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good and fast for kids does have very good control of parents on that
1992,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
1993,Health & Beauty,4,These are good batteries. How do I know. I installed these in my electric tooth brush 2 months ago. The brush is still buzzing my brain when I use it. No way any of the other batteries will do this. Been there done that.
1994,Health & Beauty,3,Just got them so i really wont kno for a few eeeks or so how good these batteries are
1995,Health & Beauty,5,Good Batteries
1996,Electronics,4,Amazon product is everything you expect it to do. It has a nice sturdy feel incapabilities two rival some of the best out there. the only drawback is the proprietary operating system and method of downloading apps can seem a little bit clunky at times but with some playing around with you get used to it.
1997,Health & Beauty,5,I've never had a problem with any of Amazons stuff. I actually prefer it over namebrand because of the cost-effectiveness if it's not something that's going to show and look tacky I could care less... batteries are one of them
1998,Electronics,3,Ive had the 1st kindle so it took time to get used to no keyboard but love the built in light that has auto adjusting. The homepage isnt as friendly
1999,Health & Beauty,5,such a great value for great batteries. i love amazon basic products.
2000,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent batteries, work well, price is right. Cannot tell difference between these and the name brand."
2001,Electronics,3,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung
2002,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I absolutely love how u. An switch from dif accounts
2003,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries for the price.
2004,Electronics,4,"I really like the Fire 8 tablet but there are some issues to be aware of. Amazon seems to subsidize the low cost of the item by requiring you to be solicited by ads and and use their apps. Every time you activate it, the screen display is a full size ad that goes away when you swipe the screen. There is no Google Play so you can only download apps chosen by Amazon at their Appstore. Otherwise, pretty cool for the money."
2005,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect. Thank you
2006,Health & Beauty,2,Buy for TV remotes. Stick with Duracell for anything else
2007,Electronics,4,I love my amazon fire tablet. It's got great screen resolution and is very easy to use. It works for both adults and kids. I love the books and all the app options.
2008,Health & Beauty,5,great
2009,Electronics,4,"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
2010,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and they last
2011,Health & Beauty,5,great buy
2012,Health & Beauty,5,Great !!!A lot of batteries.Last long and don't leak.
2013,Electronics,3,This was purchased as a gift so I can only offer an average expectation of its performance.
2014,Electronics,4,"I had also bought the amazon fire 10"" pad at the same time, I use the smaller one because it fits in the hand better. after using it for a while I purchase 3 more 8"" pads for gifts. the 10"" pad has a better screen display and sound (another good unit for the price)"
2015,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries are awesome!! They are cost effective and last just as long as Energizer or Duracell. I have used these in both low drain (toys and small electronics) as well as high drain devices (Cameras and high powered LED flashlights). Using the Subscribe and Save makes them even more cost effective.
2016,Electronics,4,"Love the backlight, great feature. Very light weight almost too much so."
2017,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy!
2018,Health & Beauty,5,These seem just as good as any other battery! Will be buying these again.
2019,Electronics,4,Working Product at the price that was advertised! Great!
2020,Electronics,4,"I bought the tablet for my 2 year grand daughter. The system comes with a set of kid friendly games and allows you to put the tablet on kid mode.. this keeps her in the ""safe zone"". I also installed ABC Mouse. Another hit program"
2021,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are very durable. AmazonBasics did very well on this product.
2022,Health & Beauty,5,excellent!
2023,Electronics,3,Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
2024,Health & Beauty,5,Prime is the best!
2025,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries I've ever bought. Last about two weeks in a remote control.
2026,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent price.
2027,Health & Beauty,4,Work as well or better than name brand. Good lasting power.
2028,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,It's difficult to navigate and not user friendly. I was hoping for better results
2029,Electronics,4,Good product if you don't want to spend money on iPad. Great just for surfing internet.
2030,Electronics,4,Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
2031,Electronics,1,This review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me. I would put it down. Just upgraded to the ECHO instead of the tap.
2032,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy.
2033,Electronics,4,Got it for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She enjoys it slot and I enjoy the time limit. So win win.
2034,Health & Beauty,1,These don't last long at all.
2035,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Works like a charm!
2036,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks worked great and fast shipping
2037,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Purchased for a youngster, so I don't have any experience for the device."
2038,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it! Long battery and is tough.She loves all the games and she learning so muchEveryday.
2039,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries and they work. The real test is for how long LOL! I'll have to get back to ya on that down the road!
2040,Health & Beauty,5,Fast and simple.
2041,Health & Beauty,4,GOOD!
2042,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, just as good as the name brands."
2043,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
2044,Health & Beauty,1,"My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries."
2045,Health & Beauty,1,"We have been extremely disappointed in these batteries. Put them in our game camera and they were dead after two weeks. Should have lasted two or three months. Same thing with everything we have used these batteries for. Don't waste your money, Buy Duracell instead."
2046,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
2047,Health & Beauty,5,Hands down better than the top brands. Thank you Amazon.
2048,Electronics,3,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
2049,Health & Beauty,5,"I never use amazon batteries before,but I love it, It's good for the price,it last just as long as duracell batteries, and the design of the batteries is just cute"
2050,Health & Beauty,4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile). If/when I do additional aaa tests/reviews in the future, I will update this list.ACDelco AAA Super Alkaline BatteriesDuracell AAA Batteries Coppertop MN2400 - 20 PackDuracell Procell AAA Batteries PC2400BKD09Energizer MAX AAA BatteriesMaxell Alkaline Battery AAA CellRayovac Alkaline AAA Batteries"
2051,Health & Beauty,5,A tremendous deal of power
2052,Health & Beauty,5,Nice one
2053,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work just fine.
2054,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,"7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work. Had go in and explain to him he couldn't download more than a hand full of apps at a time. Doesn't matter now since it won't even turn on or charge."
2055,Electronics,4,"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
2056,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I have two kids and they both love it. Its also nice because it is already setup for them.
2057,Health & Beauty,5,Good buy
2058,Electronics,4,"This fits perfect in my purse and love how clear the screen is. The price was amazing, didn't find it anywhere else close the the price."
2059,Health & Beauty,3,They run out of juice fast.
2060,Electronics,2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now...

2061,Health & Beauty,5,Great!
2062,Electronics,4,I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
2063,Electronics,4,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
2064,Health & Beauty,4,trying them out. so far so good
2065,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It's a good tablet for a young kid. A little hard to navigate even for adults. Cant figure out how to navigate the internet!
2066,Health & Beauty,2,Buy these. They do not last at all.
2067,Electronics,4,Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
2068,Health & Beauty,5,works as expected.
2069,Electronics,4,"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
2070,Electronics,3,I do like the Fire Tablet - but I feel that if it is going to have a camera it should have been a better camera. The internet works but I find it takes a while to load. I have read a book on it but - I prefer to use my original paper white - that can be read in any lighting including outside. But for what it is and the price it was - its a good product.
2071,Electronics,4,"Cheap but doesn't appear it particularly. Does it's job fine, plenty of pockets and space, much prefer it to the back pack style"
2072,Health & Beauty,4,Works as described.
2073,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent price, good long-lasting batteries. No complaints at all."
2074,Health & Beauty,1,Does not turn well at all. Will be returning it
2075,Electronics,4,"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
2076,Health & Beauty,1,"I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again."
2077,Health & Beauty,5,They are batteries...what can I say!
2078,Health & Beauty,5,great deal
2079,Electronics,4,"Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet"
2080,Health & Beauty,5,great
2081,Health & Beauty,5,Great value. Will order again.
2082,Electronics,3,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency."
2083,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
2084,Health & Beauty,5,good
2085,Health & Beauty,5,Exactly what I wanted.
2086,Electronics,4,The size and price makes this a best buy! I'm very pleased with my tablet
2087,Health & Beauty,1,some are not functioning
2088,Electronics,3,I returned it because I wanted better sound...opted for a bose soundlink. Decent speaker with nice amazon prime/Alexa features...just not the sound I was looking for.
2089,Electronics,4,"About what you'd expect from Kindle. Bluetooth connectivity, battery life all good"
2090,Electronics,2,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
2091,Health & Beauty,5,Great battery at a great price
2092,Health & Beauty,5,A great price for a quality product.
2093,Electronics,4,"A friend loves hers & told me I would love it, I do"
2094,Electronics,4,I don't know why it takes long to come on and it goes off on me my kids have no problem
2095,Health & Beauty,4,good deal good buy
2096,Electronics,3,"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
2097,Health & Beauty,5,nice
2098,Health & Beauty,5,Great product and price
2099,Electronics,4,"My Grandson can't put it down! With access to so many educational apps and games, you really can't lose."
2100,Electronics,4,"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
2101,Health & Beauty,5,Long life. Can't beat the price. These are the batteries I will buy from now on.
2102,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Tap is outstanding. There have been more applications slowly becoming avaliable. It is simple to use. It works with our Nest, which is a nice application."
2103,Health & Beauty,4,Nice to have a easy to access package that doesn't allow the batteries to just keep falling out once opened like most battery packages.
2104,Health & Beauty,3,fine
2105,Health & Beauty,5,Full of energy
2106,Health & Beauty,5,yea ther good value
2107,Health & Beauty,4,"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
2108,Health & Beauty,4,not the best but it's ok
2109,Health & Beauty,5,love it
2110,Health & Beauty,4,These alkaline batteries appear to be of good quality and provide excellent power output to my devices. Only time will tell if they provide long life in storage without leaiagel
2111,Electronics,4,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
2112,Health & Beauty,5,good value!
2113,Health & Beauty,5,Quick shipping - Happy with purchase
2114,Health & Beauty,5,great value
2115,Electronics,4,Overall good performance. It works fast and comes with many apps
2116,Electronics,2,The looks and the screen of Amazon - Fire HD 8 Kids Edition are good. The navigation is sluggish when compared to apple and Samsung. The touch screen is not very responsive. Camera is not so good. Amazon should have done much better job to make it a better product to compete with Samsung and apple. Hope Amazon makes improvements. The cost is low and appreciate that. I would not recommend to someone who is looking for good product. I cost is the factor you can live with it.
2117,Electronics,4,More confusing. It would be nice to have a manual that is not online.
2118,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries are awful. Might get 1/4 the life other batteries Ive used. Will not be buying Amazon batteries again.
2119,Electronics,1,Returned it. it was a poor reader and clearly would not last..
2120,Health & Beauty,1,I don't understand why these are rated so highly - these batteries DO NOT LAST. I have never experienced batteries that died so quickly....I used them from everything to my computer mouse to microphone and they lasted maybe about 1/4 the time of what I'm used to. I guess you get what you pay for - would never order these again
2121,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good tablet but no YouTube kids like on iPhone. Don't expect iPhone/pad quality very basic AppStore for children
2122,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal.
2123,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,This was my second kindle and I didn't realize that it wasn't paper white . What a difference. I took this back to the store and exchanged for paper white.. this was not easy to read for me
2124,Health & Beauty,5,ok
2125,Electronics,4,This is a very good tablet. The only con is you may have to reboot it too often.
2126,Electronics,4,Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
2127,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent product.
2128,Health & Beauty,5,Lots of batteries perfect for the value. They last a while.
2129,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
2130,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
2131,Electronics,4,It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
2132,Health & Beauty,4,OK
2133,Health & Beauty,5,Work great!
2134,Electronics,4,"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
2135,Health & Beauty,3,Didn't last as long as I would have liked
2136,Health & Beauty,4,Time will tell how well they perform. They are a little less expensive than Energizer and if they perform as well I'll re-order them.
2137,Health & Beauty,4,Not sure what I can say about batteries
2138,Electronics,4,Well it is not for me but it looks very nice for young kids...
2139,Health & Beauty,5,This is a solid deal. WIll buy again.
2140,Health & Beauty,5,They work well.
2141,Health & Beauty,5,great value
2142,Health & Beauty,5,Best buy and great batteries.
2143,Health & Beauty,5,Got here quickly and are packaged nicely. Most important the price is right. Highly recommended!!
2144,Electronics,4,I would go for the Echo because you can talk to it. The tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it. The speaker is good though for it's size.
2145,Health & Beauty,5,they are fresh batteries and work great
2146,Electronics,4,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it."
2147,Health & Beauty,5,just as advertised and fast shipping.
2148,Electronics,4,"Nice basic tablet for the price. Screen colors are muted and text was not that sharp. But, for the price, it does what I need it to do (surf the web, listen to music, read ebooks, watch movies)."
2149,Health & Beauty,5,work great
2150,Health & Beauty,5,Never can have too many.
2151,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,First time user - had no problem getting started - must have internet connection and know name and password for wi-fi
2152,Health & Beauty,5,Great need more
2153,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Not only is it an excellent first tablet for a child, but it is a kindle. They can grow into it as well. And from studying up on the product before hand, I was able to determine that they have excellent customer service! That is a big plus!"
2154,Health & Beauty,5,batteries are fresh
2155,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good. Let's see how they hold up over time. Hope they hold their charge and don't leak.
2156,Electronics,3,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
2157,Health & Beauty,3,"these are not comparable to Duracell, but it's cheap"
2158,Health & Beauty,5,Have not used any yet.
2159,Electronics,1,It takes forever to download apps. I'm returning it will be getting something else.
2160,Health & Beauty,1,"DO NOT BUY. All batteries arrived completely dead. I thought it might be a bad batch. Ordered more, all arrived dead."
2161,Health & Beauty,4,outstanding batterys
2162,Health & Beauty,5,Good as expected.
2163,Health & Beauty,5,Been very happy with these batteries. Will order again!
2164,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries are decent. I wouldn't consider them better than Duracell or Energizer but the price is right.
2165,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal
2166,Health & Beauty,5,I buy all my batteries here. Great long lasting batteries.
2167,Electronics,2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
2168,Electronics,4,My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
2169,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
2170,Electronics,3,"This product is ok, wasn't too impressed with the commercial was defiantly more interesting"
2171,Electronics,2,Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
2172,Health & Beauty,5,"These batteries have performed just as well as name brand batteries, and the price was very reasonable."
2173,Electronics,4,Easy to use tablet. Price is pretty good. My mom loves it.
2174,Electronics,4,"Delivered as promised, well packaged ... only problem ... does NOT appear to be waterproof ... not a good thing with these heavy South Florida rains."
2175,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries, great price, fast shipping."
2176,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for these AAA batteries!
2177,Health & Beauty,2,Seemed to die very fast.I only purchased amazon batteries about 6 months ago and already replaced them in more than one device that should last quite a bit longer.Noticed the same for the AAA
2178,Electronics,2,The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop. It'll only work if you use an extended keyboard.Impossible to type directly on the laptop b/c of poor design. The guards just need to be brought down and 1/2 their size and this would be perfect.
2179,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries last as long as the more expensive ones, such as Duracell or Energizer. I will definitely buy again!"
2180,Electronics,4,"My kids love this product, as do I. Parental restrictions can be set and they know when they have to shut them off. Good battery life too."
2181,Health & Beauty,3,"Ok for general use, but does not last long."
2182,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap reliable batteries!
2183,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Basically it does everything that adult Amazon tablet does
2184,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent item! Works great and is exactly as pictured in the description
2185,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
2186,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for a great product
2187,Electronics,4,I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
2188,Health & Beauty,5,Can't beat the price!!
2189,Electronics,3,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
2190,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good.
2191,Electronics,4,I bought this as a Christmas present on Black Friday for an incredible price
2192,Electronics,4,Easy to use even for my 3 yr old happy with how it has a lot of apps that are free same as Android to download. Good deal for the price. My son loves it.
2193,Health & Beauty,5,great batteries and haven't had any leak yet like other off price or off brand ones.
2194,Electronics,3,I'll give it 3 starts because it's a decent tablet. But if the screen messes up when I'm trying to use it i can't imagine how my granddaughter feels.
2195,Health & Beauty,5,Well if you are looking for cheap non-rechargeable batteries that last quite a while then these are perfect. Nothing more to say.
2196,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it. She loves playing the games and downloads books to read. I am so glad I got it for her.
2197,Health & Beauty,5,great value
2198,Health & Beauty,5,Work as advertised.
2199,Health & Beauty,5,its work good!!!
2200,Health & Beauty,1,Ive gone thru half the box. Everyone of these batteries lasted for about 10 minutes and then died. Not happy at all! Wasted money on something i needed.
2201,Electronics,4,Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
2202,Health & Beauty,5,They are functional batteries. Nothing really special aside from being Amazon branded
2203,Electronics,3,"My toddler did not like this tablet. It was a bit slow for her. Instead, she preferred an iPad over the Kindle Kids version."
2204,Health & Beauty,5,just what i needed
2205,Electronics,4,"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
2206,Electronics,4,Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
2207,Electronics,4,"It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
2208,Health & Beauty,5,As good as or better than name brand. Excellent value.
2209,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are awful!! I usually use duracell AA in my small Christmas light strings and they last me 2.5-3 weeks with being constantly on. These have lasted about 4 days with the same use. I read other reviews which stated they were the same but it wasn't until I put them in my normal light strings that I saw the difference. Will NOT order again.
2210,Health & Beauty,3,got it because of reviews. I really can't say they are any better than any other cheaper or more expensive brand. how can you rate it or check it. when your remotes stop working you put in new batteries.simple as that.
2211,Electronics,4,My grandson has thoroughly enjoyed it. Easy to use. He frequently sends us messages and pictures.
2212,Health & Beauty,2,The original Amazon Basics in the solid silver wrapping were great. These seem to have about a half life of those. Wouldn't recommend for use.
2213,Electronics,4,Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
2214,Health & Beauty,5,Great
2215,Health & Beauty,2,"I have encountered several AmazonBasics batteries lately which were dead on arrival. Since they are cheap, I just throw them in the trash and try some more. However this is concerning. If this occurs much more I will stop using them and purchase more traditional, reliable brands. Simply beware when you purchase these, some bad ones may be mixed in the batch."
2216,Health & Beauty,5,Very good quality. Would buy again.
2217,Electronics,4,I bought this for my husband who is in a nursing home to be able to listen to music.. He loves it... And uses it every day for music and other things too.
2218,Health & Beauty,4,Always great batteries. Good buy for the price but not the longest lasting.
2219,Electronics,4,If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
2220,Health & Beauty,5,You can't go wrong with this many batteries at this price!
2221,Health & Beauty,5,item as described.
2222,Health & Beauty,4,"I was intending to buy rechargeables, but bought these by mistake. They work fine though."
2223,Health & Beauty,4,as expected
2224,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
2225,Health & Beauty,3,Just received them and trying them out. So far so good.
2226,Health & Beauty,1,"I only have it one star because I couldn't give zero stars. Over half of the box were dead. The ones that did work, only worked for a very short time. Do not buy these batteries."
2227,Electronics,4,Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
2228,Electronics,4,"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
2229,Health & Beauty,5,Great item fOr a great price!
2230,Electronics,4,"Amazon Fire is easy to handle and read with 8"" display screen. Alexa voice is convenient. Downside is Amazon doesn't allow you to download Google as a search tool. Overall good tablet for the price."
2231,Electronics,4,"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
2232,Electronics,3,Christmas gift for 8 yr. Ended up returning. too slow and not enough content for our 8 yr old. Kids....... Great 2yr protection tho
2233,Health & Beauty,1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
2234,Health & Beauty,3,"Okay if you're using for household use, I tried to use with my speedlites for photography and these ran out entirely too quickly."
2235,Electronics,4,This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
2236,Electronics,4,1st Fire tablet. The color and screen are nice and bright. The ability to set the turn on time for night screen is nice.Miss not having some of the true Android apps like Firefox . May be the learning curve but the Silk browser header is always in the way.
2237,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Nice product, great price and expandable storage unlike the HD version"
2238,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
2239,Health & Beauty,2,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
2240,Health & Beauty,1,LOVE THE BATTERIES.THANKS
2241,Electronics,4,It is a solid product great for kids I like it a lot
2242,Health & Beauty,5,"I bought these batteries because I have had leakage problems with name branded batteries. These batteries were cheaperand seem to work well. I won't know if they leak until some time goes by,but I have had good luck with the unbrandedbatteries I purchased from Amazon in the past."
2243,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
2244,Health & Beauty,5,Just a good as the name brand.
2245,Electronics,4,Nice graphics. Fast start up..Con ads on start screen
2246,Health & Beauty,5,Great value.
2247,Electronics,4,My kids love it. Simple learn and had many accessories that can purchased to protect it.
2248,Health & Beauty,4,These work good and are just as efficient as top name in comparison this far.
2249,Health & Beauty,4,Average not that long lasting
2250,Health & Beauty,5,Very good deal
2251,Health & Beauty,5,On point
2252,Electronics,4,I bought it Xmas for my 4 yr old who always wants our iPhones to watch utube videos. It's cool looking and well made plus Alexa is helpful. It she still prefers our iPhones because the touch screen makes it a bit easier to stop her video and is more sensitive. I like it but don't live it.
2253,Electronics,3,"can't beat the price I bought this at from Best Buy. It has held up well inside the beefy case we bought for it, and the screen is nice and sharp. However, the unit did randomly shut off and refuses to power back up without ever coming into contact with water or any drops. I am glad that the replacement plan was very affordable."
2254,Electronics,4,Was a gift for 7 yr old granddaughter she just loved it one of her favorite item she plays with. It goes with her almost everywhere
2255,Health & Beauty,5,work like batteries should at much lower cost.
2256,Health & Beauty,5,Good price time will tell how they hold up. Thanks!!!
2257,Electronics,2,"The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage."
2258,Health & Beauty,5,Great product for good price
2259,Health & Beauty,5,All good
2260,Health & Beauty,3,Several if these were dead but majority are good
2261,Electronics,2,"I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet."
2262,Electronics,4,if you use it for certain things it's great. Can find most everything on it. Only a few things that can't be downloaded or found in the appstore
2263,Health & Beauty,5,great last long time
2264,Health & Beauty,5,work exactly as intended!
2265,Health & Beauty,2,I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.
2266,Health & Beauty,3,"DON'T RECHARGE THEM LIKE SERIOUSLY DON'T!!!! they work good and last but not for to long and when two of them died i decided to recharge them and it leaked all over my battery charger. my brother took a few and i had no idea he charged a few without a problem and he didn't get his stuff ruined but i did. So if I were you, don't charge them"
2267,Health & Beauty,5,"Found no difference from brand name batteries. Lasts just as long, easier to manage packaging, and it's almost one third of the price."
2268,Electronics,3,"I have an older Fire HD 7 and had started reading a lot more periodicals on it (okay, I admit it, comic books). So when the news about the Fire HD 8 7th generation went out, I put in a pre-order and eagerly anticipated its arrival so I could have just a slightly larger screen and better performance.The Fire HD 8 delivered on those two fronts. It's noticeably snappier than my HD 7, and the screen is larger. No arguing those points.My Fire HD 8 arrived charged to 73%, so I hooked it up to the included charger and set it to download some of the aforementioned periodicals. I checked on it two hours later and noticed that it had managed a measly 4% increase in battery charge in that time. Starting at 73%, I would have expected it to at least be in the mid to high 80s after two hours.After experimenting a bit, I found that the only way I could get a sort of decent charging speed was to turn the Fire HD off altogether and let it charge with absolutely nothing else running. I am now able to charge at a rate of about 1% every 10 to 15 minutes, an improvement over 1% per half hour, but it means having to fully turn off the Fire HD before I plug it in and then restart it when I want to use it again. The Fire HD 8 will maintain an even charge level while it is plugged in and in use, but don't expect it to replenish the battery in that state.Aside from that, the Fire HD 8 seems a decent tablet for a $100 price point. Just don't expect it to fully charge overnight if you deplete it the day before."
2269,Health & Beauty,1,"The batteries are sligtly bigger and will not fit in some electronics I thought AA was the standard size Nope, I was wrong, but the good news is I now am the proud owner of 48 slightly oversized batteries that do not fit in most of my battery operated devices. Perfect! Out of 9400 reviews nobody noticed the size issue with these"
2270,Electronics,4,Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
2271,Health & Beauty,5,"I've used Amazon batteries for a couple of years in everything from remotes, toys, flashlights, noise cancelling headsets, and portable games and have been very pleased. They have not let me down yet. The performance is comparable to what you get out of the leading major brands at a fraction of the price. You can save even more if you add these to your Subscribe Save items! You can't beet the price! I highly recommend them!"
2272,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
2273,Electronics,3,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
2274,Health & Beauty,4,Good quality
2275,Health & Beauty,5,good
2276,Health & Beauty,5,Good quality. Bought for baby toy last very long. Will buy them again.
2277,Health & Beauty,5,Works great and seems to last as long as my other batteries.
2278,Electronics,4,This tablet is on the smaller side but works for me.
2279,Health & Beauty,5,no issues
2280,Electronics,4,"This is a good tablet for the price, nice change from using phone"
2281,Electronics,4,"Great for in the car, restaurant, or doctor appointments!"
2282,Health & Beauty,5,"I have quickly become a fan of Amazon Basics products. You just can't beat the price and quality. These batteries run just as long as the Duracell's I had before this purchase. I bought these based on the reviews and because the price was so good. I bought both double and triple A batteries and use them is Wireless mouse ( I have 3 Amazon Basic wireless mice), TV remotes and clocks. So far, I have noticed no poor performance and the run time is as good as anything else I have tried. I keep them on a shelf in a rough room in my basement to keep them cool and dry. The do come wrapped in 4's in the box. That keeps them organized nicely in the box, but the wrapper can be a frustration so I keep a razor knife on the same shelf which make very quick work of that. Problem solved. Overall, I am totally satisfied and as I said, I will buying more of the Amazon Basics as they become available."
2283,Health & Beauty,5,Good price and last as long as most others. Also packed great.
2284,Health & Beauty,4,Work
2285,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.
2286,Health & Beauty,3,but do last longer than Duracell
2287,Health & Beauty,5,Great value and they work as good as any other brand!
2288,Electronics,4,I purchased this tablet for my mother-in-law and she loves it.
2289,Electronics,4,The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
2290,Health & Beauty,3,"Bought AmazonBasics for all the new toys my kids were getting for Christmas, all of which have had to be replaced in the past couple months. Life of this battery isn't great."
2291,Health & Beauty,1,Used these for 2 insta bulb lights purchased from here also and they last about a week. Crazy!!!
2292,Health & Beauty,5,great
2293,Health & Beauty,1,"Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point."
2294,Health & Beauty,5,Great
2295,Health & Beauty,4,good quality
2296,Health & Beauty,4,thery r batteries nothing special but a good price!
2297,Health & Beauty,4,"Good price, but have not had enough time to find out how long they last compared to other name brands."
2298,Electronics,4,"I must say this is so easy to use and convenient and so portable. If you need to entertain kids during appointments, etc., it would definitely be handy!"
2299,Electronics,4,"I was impressed with the overall of this Kindle, it has so many nice features and easy access."
2300,Electronics,4,"This is a good tablet for internet, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu and email. Only complaints are the locked screen wallpaper is an ad and the screen is not as bright as an iPad but a winner for the price."
2301,Electronics,4,"This was the perfect gift for high school graduates. I went to get the 8GB but for $10 more I could get them both more storage. Let me tell you, they loved the gift and thought it was the best of all time. I've decided this is the gift I will buy for all birthdays and holidays this year!"
2302,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries for cheap!
2303,Electronics,4,The item seems to have a 'ton' of items to view - just wish it came with some directions on use. Otherwise product is great.
2304,Health & Beauty,5,These are quality at a fair price.
2305,Electronics,4,Wanted something small and this was perfect size .
2306,Health & Beauty,3,served there purpose during christmas. not the longest life
2307,"Electronics,Media",4,"Excellent reader night or day, sunshine or shade. Not as full function as earlier kindels"
2308,Electronics,4,Bought this as a gift but was wrong item wanted so wasn't used
2309,Electronics,4,"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
2310,Electronics,4,"The Kindle will NEVER take the place of an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab but they cost very little. Perfect for kids and adults alike. Especially good for those who don't want to spend six weeks learning to use it. It's very simple to set up right out of the box. It works great with the Prime membership. If you want to watch movies or Hulu/Netflix, the iPad is superior for quality of picture. Again, you pay a hefty price for this quality. If you just want something simple and hard to break (think young kids or teens) this is definitely the best option."
2311,Health & Beauty,5,bargain
2312,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to last a long time
2313,Electronics,4,i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
2314,Electronics,4,Would have gave it a 5 star but it lost my parental setup and had to reset it one time. Other than that it has been great.
2315,Electronics,4,My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
2316,Health & Beauty,3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
2317,Electronics,3,Worth the price. Added this to my collection mainly for audible books. Don‚Äôt like the OS much.
2318,Electronics,4,"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
2319,Electronics,4,The kids more expensive tablets died twice. Repair was more than the Fire brand new.
2320,Electronics,4,I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
2321,Electronics,4,Bought for grand daughter for Xmas since most 5 year olds now a lot about tablets and had no problem with this very easy to use.
2322,Health & Beauty,4,As promised.
2323,Electronics,4,I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
2324,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,"Love the capabilities it has to offer.Downside, it totally shuts off by itself and you have to start what you doing all over again"
2325,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I purchased this tablet for my grandkids ages 2 and 4. They love it! It's easy and fun to use for toddlers. It's perfect for the educational games they enjoy.
2326,Electronics,4,"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
2327,Electronics,4,Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
2328,Electronics,3,The sleek design and colors available for small kids is good. The tablet is a nice price and useful.
2329,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, i got a 20 pack of the AA batteries. Batteries indicate good through date of 2026!Good life, bright in flashlights also. I will purchase these again, i consider them an excellent value and a great buy!"
2330,Electronics,4,My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
2331,Health & Beauty,5,great price
2332,Health & Beauty,5,great supply of batteries - especially
2333,Electronics,4,So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
2334,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
2335,Electronics,3,Nothing too special or complicated. Fills the need.
2336,Health & Beauty,5,seem to work just fine for kids toys
2337,Electronics,4,Very useful and reasonable priced merchandise also good for giving as a gift to a family member or friend.
2338,Health & Beauty,1,More then half did not work :(
2339,Electronics,4,Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
2340,Health & Beauty,1,"Asian products are infamous for their low quality, failure, and or harmful nature. These batteries produced in Indonesia live up to that reality. Out of ten batteries I finally found four that had enough juice to power the piece of equipment I purchased them for. Had I know they were made in Asia I would never have purchased them to begin with."
2341,Health & Beauty,5,great price. fast shipping recommended
2342,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
2343,Electronics,4,This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
2344,Health & Beauty,1,"Can't believe Amazon's name is on these pieces of dung. Very short life. I've migrated to Eneloop rechargeables for AAA as well as AA now big savers, as I have a lot of doodads."
2345,Health & Beauty,5,My kid goes through these like water. Expensive ones don't last much long. This is my go to brand
2346,Electronics,4,I got everything I need for personal use. A great value for a cheap price.
2347,Electronics,4,was supposed to be a gift. there was a glitch in your computer system and it told me I wouldn't receive in time. ordered another one from someone else. then received it anyway. returned to store
2348,Electronics,4,The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did
2349,Electronics,4,I bought this as a gift for my smart 1 yr old niece and she loves it. she is always using the tablet. it's her favorite toy.
2350,Health & Beauty,5,Great value and quality! Would highly recommend!
2351,Health & Beauty,5,Good price
2352,Health & Beauty,5,Recommended by Gina.
2353,Electronics,4,"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
2354,Health & Beauty,5,"Works great and cheaper than at big box stores! We have lots of frameless candles, so these are great"
2355,Electronics,4,Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip.
2356,Health & Beauty,1,"The quality of Amazon AA battery is going down. Now just after a few weeks, even when it shows full power from battery power meter, the Amazon battery cannot be used in many appliances. (bluetooth keyboard, soap dispenser...)"
2357,Health & Beauty,5,"Amazing price, amazing quality"
2358,Health & Beauty,1,"Overpriced, works about the same as raovac."
2359,Health & Beauty,5,awesome price awesome product cannot go wrong.
2360,Electronics,4,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
2361,Health & Beauty,3,Seems like it doesn't last as long as other battery brands.
2362,Electronics,4,I bought this for my mom. She enjoys checking her email and Facebook. She enjoys playing games most of all.
2363,Health & Beauty,4,hey there batteries
2364,Electronics,4,Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
2365,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Easy to read and maneuver. Just the right size. Well worth it.
2366,Electronics,4,Good but screen is not good as other tablet .. great for kids
2367,Electronics,4,Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
2368,Health & Beauty,5,great product for the price.
2369,Electronics,4,Product is great. Does a good job at interpreting voice commands. Every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection.
2370,Electronics,4,While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
2371,Electronics,4,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
2372,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I've never had a tablet other than an apple. It seems to charge quite slow but I'm not sure if it's because of the tablet or the cord or some setting I'm not aware of; but it charges ridiculously slow, other than that I am very happy since it's for my son."
2373,Health & Beauty,5,"No leak, nuff said"
2374,Health & Beauty,5,good buy..
2375,Health & Beauty,5,Best price for the number of batteries. Also last just as long as any of your name brand ones
2376,Electronics,4,He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
2377,Electronics,3,"Resolution was great, speed was good. Bought for grandson, he didn't like it because it would not run Google apps and couldn't watch u-tube without purchasing additional apps."
2378,Health & Beauty,3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
2379,Electronics,4,"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
2380,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal on batteries..Will orderd more!! Long battery life.
2381,Health & Beauty,4,Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
2382,Health & Beauty,3,These are OK for the price. I have an LED string of dewdrop lights I bought from Amazon and these batteries will last for 3-4 days of it on 24/7 but the Costco Kirkland brand batteries will last 2 weeks being lit 24/7.
2383,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent!
2384,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!"
2385,Health & Beauty,5,They are great at a great price.
2386,Electronics,3,A few problems with games loading but over all good
2387,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.
2388,Health & Beauty,5,Great Packaging. They Are Lasting
2389,Electronics,3,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
2390,Electronics,3,"Very basic. If you need more than the basics, look for an Android tablet."
2391,Health & Beauty,1,These die way too fast.
2392,Health & Beauty,5,Good value.
2393,Health & Beauty,4,Bought them for the grand kids toys at Christmas and they work fine but that's all I can tell you because it's only been 8 hours.
2394,Health & Beauty,5,Very good
2395,Health & Beauty,5,These worked out great for his battery powered cars I got him. What a awesome deal.
2396,Health & Beauty,5,great deal
2397,Electronics,3,It was great product. the price which I got it was great.
2398,Electronics,4,"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
2399,Electronics,4,"Got this tablet for my 3 year old daughter, and subscribed to free time to download all her favorites plus some new apps. The only issue is that some things take a while to install or load and sometimes freezes. Although I think that may be due more to my WiFi and the fact that I have a ton of devices on my network. I only wish that it was 4G or LTE instead of WiFI."
2400,Health & Beauty,5,These are great. Cheap and reliable.
2401,Electronics,4,"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
2402,Electronics,4,Unsure if I wanted to get another kindle or an Amazon tablet. Very happy with my purchase. Easy to use and a great price!
2403,Electronics,4,Bought this for my six year old son for a Christmas present and he loves it. He couldn't be happier it keeps him very entertained. This tablet was such a good deal definitely no complaints here. Best buy has the greatest deals love this store.
2404,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My son already had one just upgraded. But he loves it.
2405,Health & Beauty,1,"All 20 of the batteries are dead (no power). Very disappointed to receive a product with Amazon's name on it that is useless, especially as a Prime member."
2406,Health & Beauty,1,They went Dead before even using them.. The ones i used lasted maybe 4hours at best !!!
2407,Health & Beauty,5,"They are very affordable batteries. I have not run any specific testing, but so far, they have performed well, and appear to give good battery life."
2408,Health & Beauty,5,AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (20-Pack). We subscribed to this. The batteries are holding up just as good as any other. You can't beat the price either.
2409,Health & Beauty,5,Buy these all the time!!!
2410,Electronics,4,"Bought it for our 2 year old son, has really helped with his vocabulary"
2411,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product, good value"
2412,Health & Beauty,4,ok
2413,Health & Beauty,5,good battery for a great price
2414,Electronics,4,Good inexpensive tablet for my daughter. I picked up on Black Friday for 50 bucks. She loves it.
2415,Health & Beauty,5,works
2416,"Electronics,Media",4,This is my first e-reader. I didn't know about the odd refresh and it took a little while to get used to but I do love how small and light it is and that I do not have to remember to plug it in everyday
2417,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Good for little kids, it runs a little slow though"
2418,Electronics,4,"Excellent value for small laptops. Lenovo 11.2"" screens with flash memory & Microsoft Word for 1 year."
2419,Health & Beauty,2,they don't last very long
2420,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
2421,Health & Beauty,5,Lots of energy !!
2422,Health & Beauty,2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
2423,Electronics,4,"Bought 2 of these for my 6 and 8 yr old and it said it came with 32gb storage but actual storage was a little less, cant remember exactly how much probably around 20gb with the other necessary programs that come already pre-installed. They mainly use it for games and have downloaded many games on them. There is room for external storage and it also has a front and rear camera. love the product. comes in different color as well. I got the blue!"
2424,Electronics,3,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
2425,Electronics,4,Nice alternative for reading kindle books for kids. Not many features but good enough for reading.
2426,Health & Beauty,1,"WHAT THE HECK! I have a SERIOUS issue with these batteries! I put them into my Amazon FireTV remote which kept draining batteries, and within a few minutes it quit working and gave up, thinking I had a bad remote. A few days later when I opened the case the batteries were had leaked all over the compartment.Just NOW, while typing on my keyboard, several of the batteries were sitting there next to my keyboard. I heard a hiss and felt a jet of air hit my right hand and I started coughing and choking on whatever the heck it was that came out of the battery.I'm throwing these away and will never trust this brand again."
2427,Health & Beauty,5,Not much to say about batteries except they work for a good price. Having a hundred let's me share with kids and grand kids.
2428,Health & Beauty,5,Good
2429,Electronics,4,For the price I believe this is an excellent tablet .
2430,"Electronics,Media",3,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
2431,Health & Beauty,5,Does the job
2432,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. Completely exceeded my expectations.
2433,Health & Beauty,5,The batteries are good and through my research have better reviews that the Duracel Batteries.
2434,Health & Beauty,3,A lot of batteries for the good price. But they don't last too long.
2435,Electronics,4,My only problem with this tablet is if you don't have internet you lose the pictures of the games you have installed and you have to guess to open them.
2436,Health & Beauty,3,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality
2437,Electronics,4,"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
2438,Health & Beauty,4,Great price and with a name like Amazon I feel these are going to be good. I bought for my daughter because I gave her something that she needed 27 (yes!) batteries for. Great value and plan on getting again if they work like I think they will. Only a 4 star rating because I don't know how long they'll last. So far so good
2439,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are the best! I love amazon branded items!!
2440,Electronics,1,The protector was not made for the Fire 7 as it was to large and had no directions that were coherent. Worse purchase from Best Buy ever.
2441,Electronics,4,I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
2442,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are working great on my clocks
2443,Health & Beauty,3,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
2444,Health & Beauty,1,"These are the WORST batteries I have ever encountered anywhere in my 46-year life! I am appalled that Amazon put their name on them I guarantee that if these had been my first Amazon purchase, I would never have done business here again. If they had not been wrapped in packs of 4 batteries in cellophane, I would have been certain that someone else had used them all up and then returned these batteries to Amazon.None of the batteries was anywhere close to full power - they couldn't provide adequate power to anything I tried them in for any battery-powered item to work properly. Candles and flashlights were so dim I would have required more of them than I am physically capable of carrying to avoid tripping over my own feet. None of the appliance remotes would even turn their respective appliances on after these batteries were inserted. Every item I tried these batteries in also stopped working completely due to a dead battery in less than 30 minutes.Obviously, I should have returned these batteries, and I'm sure I would have done so if my mom had not had a heart attack shortly after I received them. I am just grateful she is now doing so well that neither she nor her cardiac surgeon have to rely on any battery-powered device!!!"
2445,Electronics,4,I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
2446,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries, they work."
2447,Health & Beauty,5,They work great!
2448,Electronics,4,"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
2449,Electronics,4,I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
2450,Electronics,4,"Tablet work great, good battery life. Just not a lot storage, but has micro SD card slot."
2451,Electronics,4,This was my second e reader and I love it easy to operate along with a lot of apps available.
2452,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries and prick is right
2453,Health & Beauty,5,thank you
2454,Health & Beauty,1,I got these batteries on Amazon Prime Day and I thought I got a good deal but half of them don't work!!! Very disappointed.
2455,Health & Beauty,3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
2456,Health & Beauty,4,Will by there again
2457,Health & Beauty,5,"i now use AA and AAA amazon batteries, great price, same quality as name brands."
2458,Electronics,1,"Bought this mostly as a backup.and to read a few books, since I have a larger cell phone and a back up. Used it occasionally may 40 or 50 hours of use till this week when I sent my laptop in for repairs. so I probably used it a tot this week. I was watching my 3rd Primetime video this week and it simply turned off. It will not turn on using any power trick such as safe mode. It is gone, It is toast. Bought it October 11, 2016 , It quit on February 9, 2015. My old Fire lasted 4 or 5 years with more use. it had stereo speakers, lasted a week on a charge not 2 or 3 days.Sturdier built. This is full of junk, I am not just offered more apps, it is constantly trying to add them. JUNK JUNK JUNK"
2459,Electronics,4,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
2460,Electronics,4,"Got this for my wife for reading Kindle and ordering on Amazon. It is a nice unit, has quick response time and was a good value."
2461,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet for kids. It has a separate screen for kids that has all their content so you know they are not doing anything they are not supposed to do. There are a lot of parental controls and time settings for restricting how long they are able to watch videos, play games, or read."
2462,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
2463,Health & Beauty,5,awesome stuff
2464,Health & Beauty,4,"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!"
2465,Health & Beauty,2,"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away"
2466,Electronics,4,This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
2467,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal on batteries.
2468,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,This tablet is grrrrrrreeeeeeeeaaaaaattttttt for the children!
2469,Health & Beauty,5,AA batteries- good quality can't beat the value.
2470,Electronics,4,"Serves its purpose for the price. Would much rather have the iPad for ease of use, but it is well protected and good my my toddler to play with and not make me worry about it being broken."
2471,Electronics,1,Very cheap and was not impressed at all never again
2472,Health & Beauty,3,I use a headlamp at work all day and everyday. I decided to try these instead of the duracells that I normally use and they definently don't last nearly as long. I don't understand all the good reviews about these. I won't purchase again.
2473,Electronics,4,Bought this for vacations at the beach - easy to read in the sulight.
2474,Health & Beauty,5,My PS3 remote control and my television remote controls work again thanks to these AAA batteries.
2475,Health & Beauty,5,great
2476,Electronics,4,I recently bought two new amazon tablets for an 8 and 10 year old and they're thrilled with them!
2477,Electronics,4,Bought this for my grandson along with a case for his birthday. He loves it and all the apps available for a kid his age.
2478,Electronics,4,So it is working great. She loves the learning games
2479,Health & Beauty,5,I haven't used very many yet but they seem to be ok.
2480,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries
2481,Health & Beauty,4,I've tried a lot of different batteries for my headlamps and they seem to last the longest and have the lowest price on a per battery basis. I have been using the Amazon batteries for about six months now. I guess the battery can never last as long as I think it should last so I gave it the four stars for that reason.
2482,Health & Beauty,5,Great battery just as good as the name brands.
2483,Health & Beauty,5,good batteries good price
2484,Electronics,1,I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
2485,Health & Beauty,5,"very good quality batteries , excellent price"
2486,Health & Beauty,5,"excellent value, seem to be excellent batteries and extra leak protection makes them even better, I will buy more"
2487,Electronics,4,This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
2488,Electronics,4,"This little tablet surprised me. I did not expect to get that smooth of an experience on it. I thought I would need the later Ipads to get decent performance but these units handled everything I needed to do. Videos play awesome, scrolling is super smooth. Activating the tablet is also a breeze, just need an Amazon account which is free. Battery life could be better and could have included a stylus but still great tablets for beginners."
2489,Electronics,4,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
2490,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good with these Amazon Basic batteries as i have only had them for a short period. Only time will tell how they perform or if they are prone to leakage over time.
2491,Health & Beauty,5,I only buy amazon batteries now. can't beat em
2492,Health & Beauty,2,"These don't last long. Won't be buying anymore, wish they had been better!"
2493,Health & Beauty,2,I probably wouldn't buy these again. Each set of 4 batteries is individually shrink wrapped and very difficult to get apart. I'm sure batteries are fine if you don't mind the packaging.
2494,Electronics,4,It is super easy to set daily limits and goals for children on the device. Remember to set up Amazon Household which makes installing apps via site easier. Has everything a typical Android tablet has.
2495,Electronics,4,Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
2496,Health & Beauty,3,"I used these batteries in one of my game cameras, but the life of theAmazon Basic battery did not last as long compared to name brand batteries. I really don't believe they are worth the savings when the Basics probably didn't take half the pictures in the game camera as Duracell. I will use these batteries in remote and my kids toys."
2497,Electronics,4,Great Bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of Alexa
2498,Health & Beauty,5,awesome price and last longer than duracell
2499,Health & Beauty,4,"I haven't calculated the life VS cost break-even, but these have worked well in all of my devices. I would order again just because of the bargain and convenience."
2500,Health & Beauty,5,very good quality!
2501,Health & Beauty,4,hard to find a better deal then this
2502,Electronics,4,Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
2503,Health & Beauty,5,works as expected
2504,Electronics,3,Great case ok tablet no Android play store. Weak micro usb port. It's isn't an straight out the box tablet. Had to install Android play store on it. And as far as the charging port goes I'm on my 3rd one but best buy are the best with their return policy...
2505,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
2506,Health & Beauty,4,Good quality batteries at a reasonable price.
2507,Health & Beauty,5,super
2508,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet to read books and it also has other good qualities.
2509,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries
2510,Electronics,3,I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
2511,Health & Beauty,4,Great so far.
2512,Electronics,4,"It's was good for handling light weight and comfortable in hand. Good audio clarity, video everything is good. But only few supportable apps. Need more apps which we use generally."
2513,Health & Beauty,5,Works good.
2514,Health & Beauty,5,Works well.
2515,Health & Beauty,4,"These are a great price. I'm not sure they last as long as a name brand battery, but they get the job done."
2516,Health & Beauty,5,They work great and they're cheaper than any other brand. I buy all my batteries from Amazon now.
2517,Health & Beauty,1,Good price with ugly design.
2518,Health & Beauty,5,"so far, so good"
2519,Health & Beauty,5,Comparable to Duracell brand batteries.
2520,Electronics,4,Works good not as fast but great colors and sounds
2521,Health & Beauty,2,"For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Sadly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I swapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life. Boo to you Amazon for selling batteries that don't actually work."
2522,Electronics,4,"Like this a lot, just wish they would come with more instructions on all the things that can be done on it."
2523,Health & Beauty,1,DID NOT RECIEVE AA I only recieved Cbatteries!
2524,Health & Beauty,5,Really great product. Tons of batteries and for super cheap. I haven't had any of these die on me yet but even if they last only half of other brands it's still a really great buy. Super happy.
2525,Electronics,4,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
2526,Health & Beauty,1,Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.
2527,Health & Beauty,3,so so
2528,Health & Beauty,3,Basic battery
2529,Electronics,4,Good product I would recommend it to everyone thank you
2530,Electronics,1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
2531,Health & Beauty,5,Works just as well as other batteries and for less money.
2532,Electronics,3,"Purchased this for my 18 month old granddaughter, had to return the first one due to it crashing. The second one has done the same , but plan on giving it a few more days before returning it. A little disappointed with it, expected it to be better than what it is."
2533,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
2534,Electronics,4,Haven't opened them yet. Christmas gift to the kids
2535,Electronics,4,"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
2536,Health & Beauty,1,"Lasted less than half the time of a Duracell alkaline battery in the same conditions. (LED candles, on continuously)."
2537,Electronics,4,Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
2538,Health & Beauty,5,"Can not complain, they arrived on time, I'm not expecting them to last too long, but I needed batteries for some toys, so."
2539,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to be comparable to other alkalines
2540,Health & Beauty,4,"Good price, decent battery life"
2541,Health & Beauty,4,"Haven't used them, they look fine. Probably overpaid. They arrive in a fancy cardboard box, like they're collectibles or something."
2542,Health & Beauty,5,Don't look further for any other brand. You get double the amount of batteries for the same price compared to other brands. The battery life is comparable to the other name brands. Must have for every household.
2543,Health & Beauty,4,FAIR PRICE
2544,Health & Beauty,4,"AAA alkaline Amazon batteries, they have a good price and seems to be working well, I will buy them again."
2545,Health & Beauty,5,Such a great value!!!
2546,Health & Beauty,5,Good product
2547,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
2548,Electronics,4,"This has been a great replacement for my daughters Leap Pad. The parental controls are very functional and the year free download of everything has been worthwhile. I really appreciate the usage timers - they are customizable and I can set a time limit for apps, a different time limit for reading and a third time limit for videos. The case seems sturdy and should prevent damages due to drops. On top of this, it is a fully functional Kindle, and I am able to use it when she is not!"
2549,Health & Beauty,5,Prior reviews were very good on these batteries so we thought we would give them a try. So far so good! All are still working as described . Will change review should we need to- but now highly satisfied .
2550,Electronics,4,"I bought this tablet for my 3rd grader, she loves it! She will be on it for hours at a time, there's a feature that allows me to put time limits which I love. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes the filtered content doesn't have a lot of options. However, I would buy again."
2551,Electronics,3,"Good tablet for Amazon lovers, not so good for Android lovers.Too much Amazon advertising ad nauseum.. Can't get Google Play apps. Miss google. Returned to store.thanks"
2552,Electronics,4,"I'm using it to keep track of my tools using the Sails app. it is great for this. The only flaw I see is that the display is insensitive to using a pen. My touch is much better. I was hoping to use the pen since when I access it, I may have dirty fingers after using my tools."
2553,Health & Beauty,1,"Terrible. Just changed the batteries on my wireless keyboard... yesterday. Already dead. Put another set in low powered christmas lights. Dead in about an hour. (I have another identical christmas light set, powered by Energizer batteries. Still going after many many days of running).Unfortunately bought the 48 pack. Won't make this mistake again."
2554,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff
2555,Health & Beauty,2,"I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months."
2556,Health & Beauty,5,"I haven't tested the duration of the power from the battery, but the price, quality of shipping, quality it of the batteries are Excellent."
2557,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
2558,Electronics,4,I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
2559,Health & Beauty,1,"I have two Macs, each with their own wireless mac keyboards. I used these batteries in both keyboards and each worked great for several days. My desk keyboard failed to connect last week so I attempted to replace the batteries, but they had expanded inside the keyboard and will not come out. I assumed it was a chance happening. But now my wireless keyboard at my downstairs computer just failed. The batteries have expanded inside that keyboard as well and will not come out. Amazon refunded us for the batteries but now we need to replace the two keyboards the batteries ruined."
2560,Health & Beauty,5,Best bargain in batteries I've found yet!
2561,Health & Beauty,5,These Amazon AA batteries are great. They are just as good as any high priced battery.
2562,Electronics,3,ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
2563,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Very happy with this ""basic"" ereader. Battery is great, visibility is great (even though it's not a ""paperwhite""), and form factor is comfortable. Special offers (ads) are totally non-invasive and I hardly notice anything; especially since I use the reader with wifi turned off. Sometimes I wish the power button was on the top of the device rather than bottom where I feel I'm more likely to accidentally press it, but hardly a true problem."
2564,Health & Beauty,1,"Very Poor battery life... Did not even last 30 minutes in my device where I've had top notch Energizer batteries that lasted weeks if not months!!!These just do not compare to top of the line batteries. Maybe good for a TV remote, but that's about it."
2565,Health & Beauty,1,"I am very disappointed in these batteries. They do not work, or if they do work it is only for a few minutes. They are a waste of money."
2566,Health & Beauty,5,Great Batteries. Cost and shipping was well worth it.
2567,Electronics,4,It's great to some extent but I was expecting more. It's unfortunate that it does not work with lots of apps. Perhaps I'm not using them correctly. I'm still learning.
2568,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries worked great at a reasonable price. I used them in an xbox one controller, which can eat up batteries, and received similar battery life to more expensive name brand batteries."
2569,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,This was purchased as a replacement for one that was dropped one to many times. Hope this one lasts as long and stands up to the abuse the first one endured.
2570,Health & Beauty,5,Great product. The price is great as well!
2571,Health & Beauty,1,Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
2572,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my wife. She is a constant reader and put away her previous Kindles for this one. She now has internet access also, so she can find more books anytime she wants."
2573,Electronics,4,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
2574,Health & Beauty,1,"If I could give this 0 stars, I would. They all have problems working and the batteries have to be replaced after one use. Waste of time for what you get."
2575,Electronics,1,Bought this for my daughter(3) and she can't even use it because it is NOT kid friendly. It is so incredibly slow!! It freezes often and does not seem to work without wifi like it is supposed to. Also was supposed to come with a year free of Amazon free time and we have been charged for it every month !( it requires you to put a card number in before initial use. ) Keep calling Amazon and the foreign people can't seem to figure out the problem. Don't buy!
2576,Health & Beauty,5,"You know those crazy cheap batteries that are so light you practically hit yourself in the face when you pick one up These aren't those.I've already purchased a couple sets of these and have been really happy with the quality/lifespan. I'd say they're DEFINTELY comparable to the more expensive name brands. I've happily recommended them to friends and family, and it's so handy always having plenty of AA batteries, especially around birthdays and holidays!"
2577,Electronics,4,"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
2578,Electronics,4,My grandkids love's it always on it great learning tool
2579,Electronics,4,"She loves it, plays with it everyday all day. Thanks"
2580,Electronics,4,Purchased for the grandkids to use while they are visiting. They never seem to get bored.Tip. Make sure you have it password protected or you may find a rapid run up in charges!
2581,Health & Beauty,1,I used them for my Xbox 1 controllers. They do not last long compared to name brands.
2582,Health & Beauty,3,They really don't last very long
2583,Electronics,2,"The tap is a great concept, I love my echo so a portable one was that much better. However the sound is pretty terrible, no bass and can be scratchy.. It was a good concept just poor execution."
2584,Electronics,4,Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
2585,Health & Beauty,3,"I haven,t had them long enough"
2586,Electronics,3,"good for reading books. light, handy but not so much for browsing."
2587,Health & Beauty,2,"These die out super quickly. In saying that, I'm not sure if the items they were in sucked the life out of the faster but they still died. Used nearly a whole pack for little LED closet lights in a couple of months - only on for a few minutes at s time."
2588,Health & Beauty,4,Affordable and usable.
2589,Health & Beauty,4,"Perfectly respectable battery.I have been using Duracell batteries almost exclusively since I first went to sea in the 1970s. No complaints then. Still no complaints.I bought some of these AmazonBasics batteries just to try them out. Nothing scientific--other reviewers have done that well enough.Basically I'm satisfied. When I'm at sea I'll probably stick with Duracells, but these Amazon Basics are getting the job done at home."
2590,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent product, powerful batteries!"
2591,Electronics,4,"Although this tablet is not really for everyday normal use due to some of its limitations, I was looking for a good replacement for a very old ipad that was slowing down. Picked this up for less than 40 dollars and really can't complain considering my last ipad was over 500. Good starting tablet or for those that do not need much,"
2592,Health & Beauty,1,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
2593,Health & Beauty,5,"They are batteries, they worked, enough said....."
2594,Electronics,4,Tap makes a great mobile Alexa device. Not as loud as Echo but still louder than the Dot. Voice enabled Alexa works but doesn't detect voice as easy as the Echo or Dot. As a mobile Bluetooth speaker though it works fine.
2595,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries and will purchase again. Can't beat the price.
2596,Health & Beauty,2,"These are low powered, don't last long even in tv remite you arelucky to get a week out of them. Energizer s last a year usually. Don't wasteyour money."
2597,Health & Beauty,5,No problem with these.
2598,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This is a great amazon fire tablet for kids highly recommend
2599,Electronics,4,Fast inexpensive tablet. Great deal !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2600,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 2 years old daughter really likes it. It's friendly and easy to use.
2601,Health & Beauty,4,Better than expected for Amazon brand batteries
2602,Health & Beauty,5,No problems with AmazonBasic Batteries.
2603,Electronics,4,My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
2604,Health & Beauty,5,good price
2605,Health & Beauty,4,Good value and dependable
2606,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent buy.
2607,Health & Beauty,2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
2608,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
2609,"Electronics,Media",4,"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
2610,Electronics,4,"Got fort my kid, had Christmas and birthday money. Wanted their own tablet and worked good as we are prime members."
2611,Health & Beauty,4,"I was so glad to see these batteries in large quantities on amazon!!! I am so tired of paying so much for them at local retailers for packages much smaller. I plan on buying them from here from now on and keeping all my battery operated candles and lights in full use! The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is that I haven't used them yet but I usually by generic brands from the locals so these are probably going to be a better quality.Our household really goes through these daily for remotes, candles, string lights whatever....you name it we need batteries for it. :)"
2612,Health & Beauty,5,Great
2613,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it. She is disabled and is actually learning her site words from school from the books app. Being ADHD she can sit for along time playing. Love that it is geared for kids.
2614,Electronics,4,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
2615,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent for price
2616,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!
2617,Health & Beauty,5,I don't think I'll ever buy duracell again
2618,Electronics,3,"Not very user friendly and intuitive.Very limited capabilities and apps.Good for viewing movies.Very limited language capabilities other than English and a few other languages.Apps are downloaded, but can't be found."
2619,Electronics,4,This is an amazing product for reading books and watching movies.
2620,Health & Beauty,5,Good
2621,Health & Beauty,4,Nice.
2622,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT DEAL !!!!!!!!
2623,Health & Beauty,5,Great seal for batteries
2624,Health & Beauty,5,"Unbeatable for the price. Haven't tested in depth, but seem to last just as long as any name brand AA's."
2625,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries last about a week in a wall clock- name brands last six months. Don't waste your money.
2626,Health & Beauty,5,"Seem to last just as long as the name brands, for a fraction of the cost!"
2627,Electronics,4,"Bought this as a gift for my 2yr old. He loves it. Couldn't tear him away from it even when the batteries die. Wanted to get him his own data plan for when we travel longer distances so I attempted to add him to my phone plan. The only problem is the device doesn't have the option to add a sim-card, so my attempt was futile. Its really draining on my phones battery life and data to keep tethering. Soon will be looking in to another tablet/iPad option that allows for the usage of a sim-card some way or another when WiFi isn't available."
2628,Health & Beauty,2,Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands.
2629,Health & Beauty,3,It's a great price but the batteries do not last long at all!
2630,Health & Beauty,5,you always need AA batteries very good
2631,Health & Beauty,1,short battery life
2632,Electronics,4,It is good to have this as a backup. Lags performance eventually. Not worth for the money.
2633,Electronics,4,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
2634,Health & Beauty,4,Thank You!
2635,Health & Beauty,1,Was very disappointed to see that one of my batteries corroded and leaked in a device within only a few days of placing it in the device. Will not purchase again.
2636,"Electronics,Media",4,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy."
2637,Health & Beauty,5,I will never not buy batteries from Amazon in bulk again! Cheapest price for a ton of batteries! I feel like I'll never run out!
2638,Electronics,4,My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
2639,Health & Beauty,4,"Bulk batteries is a must when you have three kids and two of them are twin toddlers. Battery operated toys save your sanity. I do wish more and more of these toys were rechargeable though, but until the toy companies catch up with us we can rely on Amazon Basics to provide us with what we need at an efficient cost. The batteries last a long time. Energenizer Batteries are a bit longer lasting, but these suit me just fine. Get them on subscription."
2640,Electronics,4,"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
2641,Health & Beauty,5,Just as good as energizers except they cost less
2642,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my wife for Christmas. We have been using a Nook for the last 2 years (bought at Best Buy - got 2 and a great deal) Can't use Nook to read in sunlight. The Voyage is smaller, lighter and easier to use. Have not used it yet to read in sunlight. Wish it had some other features like - color display and sound. Waiting to see if I decide to get one until then I still am using a Nook. Very easy to download a book from public library. It is a tad expensive for what it does."
2643,Health & Beauty,5,Long lasting
2644,Health & Beauty,4,"Amazon Batteries! They got me on the price, but how's the performance! Honestly I can't tell cause who's counting I usually by pro cells because Sometimes I'm a pro. Just kidding but really i work in entertainment so we use pro cells but I bought a box of these just to keep handy and save the day when pro cells are not available. These really aren't that bad. Pro TIP: Make sure you dispose them properly so you don't kill the earth. I'd definitely buy these again. Now that I am a father, there's all kinda of other things to put batteries in. Also do not skimp out on your earthquake kit. It sounds like whatever but honestly you need to prepare folks!"
2645,Electronics,4,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
2646,Electronics,4,"Product was purchased for 6 year old. Very excited to use. Had a hard time navigating initially. Battery life not as expected(too short). Short charging chord. Charging port at tablet site, easily worn. Very positional when charging when plugged in. Will stick with Apple products for now."
2647,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
2648,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Nice size works fine needs to weigh a little less.
2649,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
2650,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Overall I wasn't too impressed with his tablet. Actually returned it for an iPad mini bc my kid like it better and it was easier to use.
2651,Electronics,4,Pretty decent tablet. Good for mindless games and Netflix. You get what you pay for.
2652,Health & Beauty,4,"I purchased these AmazonBasics batteries because I used a lot of batteries around the house and I was looking for the best value. I would say the convenience factor is there: I can stock up on these and I don't have to run to the store to pick up batteries. Compared to the Rayovac brand, which I have been using exclusively before purchasing these, I would say the AmazonBasics batteries give you just a bit less life. They do store well and perform well in most electronics that I've tested thus far."
2653,Health & Beauty,4,"As advertised, I have not had any problems."
2654,Health & Beauty,4,Work well at a great price point.
2655,Health & Beauty,5,"I used to buy batteries from Costco which come under Kirkland brand. I thought of testing Amazon Basics based on my experience of other Amazon Basics products in the past. These batteries are way better than Kirkland, Energizer and Duracell. The cost is nicely placed. Now my kids have more time to play with toys before the need to replace the batteries. A clear thumbs up!"
2656,Electronics,4,"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
2657,Electronics,4,"I am really enjoying this device, I wanted something to use for entertainment purposes when camping. Something small yet powerful and this works perfect. 5 stars if your a prime member like me that way you can take advantage of the many thing prime has to offer yet still have available almost every other digital services out there. Would and have recommended this product."
2658,Health & Beauty,4,"used them for multiple electronics, so far... no problems"
2659,Electronics,4,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
2660,Electronics,4,If you're looking for something basic at a good price then these are for u. These are not iPad quality but if u have prime then it's well worth it.
2661,Electronics,4,"I got this for reading books, I still like ipad better though."
2662,Electronics,4,You can't do better for$60. My only concerns is the battery life could be a bit better and it has a cheap plastic feel to it. Great for light browsing and Kindle reading though.
2663,Electronics,4,This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
2664,Health & Beauty,4,They work great!
2665,Health & Beauty,4,I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
2666,Electronics,4,nice size tablet with a good protective case that is easy to hold onto
2667,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
2668,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
2669,Electronics,4,"Nice screen, got it at discounted price for my kid, replaced a smaller one he broke. Tip add a child proff cover. The migration executive experience amazing! Picked up from cloud and i was good to go!"
2670,Health & Beauty,3,doesn't work with everything. baby toys good. electronics not so much
2671,Health & Beauty,5,Good value and appear to last as long a national brands costing much more.
2672,Electronics,4,I was looking for a cheap tablet that ran a lot of Android apps. This was perfect.
2673,Health & Beauty,5,We've ordered these a few times cause we've been so happy with product. These are good quality. We are also happy with price. I would recommend these.
2674,Electronics,3,"I had to sideload google play services to be able to download from the google play store or use google chrome as a web browser, as this tablet was designed to be exclusive to Amazon."
2675,Electronics,4,"Gave as Gift. the recipient powered down his IPad, and is giving it away."
2676,Electronics,4,"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
2677,Health & Beauty,4,working great so far
2678,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
2679,Health & Beauty,3,Very weak batteries.
2680,Electronics,3,"My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books."
2681,Health & Beauty,2,Don't seem to last as long as Duracell.
2682,Health & Beauty,4,"Good dela on the batteries, will see if they perform OK."
2683,Health & Beauty,4,You cannot get a better battery for the price. Only thing I hate is the packaging.
2684,Health & Beauty,3,1
2685,Electronics,4,Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
2686,Electronics,4,"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
2687,Health & Beauty,4,"No problems here! Using these for a variety of things, mostly just remotes and Xbox controllers though they have also been used in an external DSLR flash with no problems."
2688,Health & Beauty,5,Use them in battery operated candles and they last alot longer than duracell PROCELL
2689,Electronics,4,Nice tablet. Functions very much like an adult tablet. Clear screen and drop case are very good.
2690,Electronics,4,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
2691,Health & Beauty,5,works well and is a value for money buy.
2692,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
2693,Electronics,1,Could not get it to work properly. I put the app on my phone and my computer. I reached out for help. They responded and it still didn't work. I finally got frustrated and returned it.
2694,Health & Beauty,1,Die way too fast
2695,Health & Beauty,1,"I like these batteries, but a couple of times now after putting them in I have opened up the compartments to find battery acid leaking out inside, I figured it was just a one off, but it has now happened several times, I am reluctant to use them anymore in case I damage items"
2696,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,A great money saving alternative to the ipad for my son who likes ti play games and read books.
2697,Health & Beauty,4,Good buy
2698,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for kids. My grandson (5 years) is very happy with it
2699,Electronics,4,"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know."
2700,Electronics,4,I got this tablet for Skype calls and browsing. It's good if you don't have an ample scope of tasks
2701,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I like that it is not linked to google, this tablet has better parental controls,and its perfect for little ones the case is a awesome bonus also."
2702,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet cause it was super cheap during December. It's a good tablet for someone who doesn't need a powerhouse
2703,Health & Beauty,1,"I thought I was getting a deal when I saw these batteries. Unfortunately, they died after two weeks. I do not recommend buying this brand."
2704,Health & Beauty,5,as described
2705,Electronics,4,"I bought two of these kindles. One for my preteen granddaughter whom had no problem at all being up and running. However, My senior mother found that the touch screen was not sensitive enough for the menu to drop easily for her. As a first time user on the kindle fire my mom will take time getting used to it. However, my tech savvy granddaughter loves her already."
2706,Health & Beauty,5,"Work great, like the packaging and good value"
2707,Health & Beauty,1,In Firestick remote it lasts about a week before replacement is required. Digging deeper alkaline batteries only last as long as they retain the upper percentage of their voltage. Either I have a bad batch or these degrade quickly in remotes. I plan on asking Amazon why this basic is so short lived in peak voltage retention.
2708,Electronics,4,"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
2709,Health & Beauty,5,"These are just as good, likely better then name brand at half the cost."
2710,Electronics,4,I like the Amazon Platform that it is on as it ties into my Amazon account.
2711,"Electronics,Media",4,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine."
2712,Electronics,4,This tablet is good for kids but the battery life is not very long.
2713,Electronics,4,I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
2714,Health & Beauty,4,Great price! I finally put a big storage shelf in my garage so starting to stock up on things I use regularly. My only complaint is they are packaged in groups of four which is kind of a pain to unwrap each time you need them.
2715,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries die fast
2716,Health & Beauty,5,Love the product and the price.Batteries work great. I love that I can keep extras on hand. Batteries come in either brown sturdy box or plastic box.
2717,Health & Beauty,1,we will never buy any more!!!! they suck!!!!!
2718,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Bought for my granddaughter she loves it. She is starting her first series
2719,Electronics,4,this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
2720,Health & Beauty,5,"High quality, long lasting, fast delivery. And a great price. Can't beat that! I recommend buying in bulk."
2721,Electronics,4,"Have been using the older kindle fire 7"" for my kids and wanted something to gift. Kindle at this price is a very attractive product. The updates in the hardware are noticible when I compare them to my kids kindle. I gave 4 stars as I am mentally comparing this to a full featured device like the surface or the iPad Pro."
2722,Health & Beauty,4,This is so so.it is doing good.i do not know how long it can last.this is also pretty good.
2723,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."
2724,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"I am disappointed that this is not more toddler friendly. It is a kindle inside a kid proof case. You have to set up child locks, etc. My biggest complaint is most of the games that are available you have to be connected to the internet. I wanted something to take to church, in the car, etc."
2725,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries at a fantastic price. Don't buy your batteries from Wal-Mart when you can get more than twice as many for a cheaper price on Amazon.
2726,Electronics,4,The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
2727,Electronics,4,Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
2728,Health & Beauty,4,"What more can you ask for. I will not buy Duracell again until I am certain their manufacturing mishaps have been fixed, I have had numerous Duracell batteries burst within the device they are powering lately. I cannot trust them anymore."
2729,Electronics,4,"So far I have been very happy with this tablet. It is fast and user friendly. The camera is not very useful as the quality is lacking, but for me it does not make much of a difference."
2730,Health & Beauty,4,Bought them for the grand kids toys at Christmas and they work fine but that's all I can tell you because it's only been 8 hours.
2731,Health & Beauty,5,"Great buy, would do it again!"
2732,Electronics,4,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
2733,Electronics,4,It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
2734,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Its a nice little set up but it's slow. I wish I would have investigated them a little more before just jumping in.
2735,Health & Beauty,5,thanks
2736,Health & Beauty,1,Didn't have hardly any charge to them. A total waste of money.
2737,Health & Beauty,3,Doesn't last long at all
2738,Health & Beauty,5,Good experience.
2739,Electronics,4,Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
2740,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal on AAAs.
2741,Health & Beauty,4,As expected
2742,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries at a great price
2743,Health & Beauty,5,My kid loves the price and the batteries r great for his gaming
2744,Health & Beauty,4,Excelente
2745,Health & Beauty,5,"Item as describe, 5 stars"
2746,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and lasts just as long as leading brands of batteries.
2747,Electronics,2,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
2748,Health & Beauty,5,"great price, great basic battery"
2749,Health & Beauty,5,I more than recommend this purchase. I encourage it. The batteries work great. A bargain at the price and how many you get. I won't be buying batteries anywhere else again.
2750,Electronics,4,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
2751,Health & Beauty,5,"Using my el cheapo multimeter (Fluke was at work) all batteries were well within the my device's tolerance for reading resting voltage and internal resistance. No duds here, no significant variation. They come wrapped four cells per cellophane heat shrink wrapper in a well constructed box. The wrapping on the batteries is of very high quality, much better than other name brands, let alone budget batteries I've bought. While I cannot yet comment on lifespan, I expect them to last a long time in the low drain LED lights I am using them for. For anything but AAA and CR123, I'd highly recommend buying rechargeable units and a quality charger, but for the price, I will be purchasing these AmazonBasics AAAs for as long as they are available."
2752,Health & Beauty,4,"For the price a great value, will never buy another overpriced brand name battery again."
2753,Health & Beauty,1,Great deal price wise but don't seem to last very long at all. So really not a good deal at all. Would not buy again.
2754,Health & Beauty,4,Good price works fine.
2755,Health & Beauty,5,"Crazy cheap. They last about as long as name brand batteries in my Xbox controllers, TV remote, and my expansive AmazonBasics adult toy collection. What more needs to be said"
2756,Health & Beauty,1,Some of the unused batteries stored in AC room show signs of deterioration within six months of purchase. Poor battery performance
2757,Health & Beauty,4,These die so fast. I might as well have bought a 12pack at. Costco or something. Good if u want clock battery that doesn't consume much energy
2758,Electronics,4,"But, I can't figure out how to move books I've read, into the Cloud? I don't like clutter, and the more I read and download, just clogs up."
2759,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries do not come close to duracel in terms of longevity.
2760,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my mom who is 93 and her other Fire deceased. It was very easy for me to set up for her and transfer over her account information. She has really enjoyed using it and has even started using some new apps. Due to her age and my not living closer, it would be nice to be able to have a print copy of how to do things. Otherwise it is surprisingly easy for her to use."
2761,Health & Beauty,5,great price
2762,Health & Beauty,1,"I bought these because of all the ratings on Amazon but they don't last at all!! I am so disappointed. I used the in every device and every solar light and withing 2 months I have to replace them all. Now, with the the snow and cold, my yard is dark because I can't get out there. I will never buy these again."
2763,Health & Beauty,4,good batteries
2764,Electronics,1,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
2765,Electronics,4,Nice tablet at a very affordable price.............
2766,Electronics,4,this is a replacement for the kindle that i dropped. I love the new features of this model.
2767,Health & Beauty,1,"Four in the batch leaked and caused a mess in my charger and device. I threw out the remaining to avoid future problems. In addition, the batteries didn't hold their charge. I presume I must have received a bad batch based on all the positive reviews."
2768,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
2769,Electronics,3,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.
2770,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
2771,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for the price. This may not be the fastest tablet, but it has handled any app I've put on it. The only downside is the Amazon add wake up page."
2772,Health & Beauty,2,Wore out quickly
2773,Health & Beauty,4,DIDN'T SEEM TO LAST AS LONG AS OTHERS BUT NOT REAL BAD
2774,Electronics,4,Amazon has consistently delivered quality tablets at the best prices and this is no exception.
2775,Health & Beauty,4,Good
2776,Health & Beauty,5,"As a Mom of 3 young kids, we go through batteries very quick! I've tried all types of batteries from name brand, to various store brands. Amazon compares to the top brands I've used, and in fact I would consider it a top brand. They last twice as long in my son's wireless PlayStation controllers than the Toys R Us brand we were previously using. You can't beat the price for the quality and I will only buy Amazon batteries from now on!"
2777,Health & Beauty,3,cheap battery power but they don't last well
2778,Health & Beauty,3,Not sure. have not fully tested the performance of this item.
2779,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
2780,Electronics,4,"You really cant beat the value of Kindle Fire tablets. You get decent specs for under $80. The speakers are decent, the screen isn't bad, and there are quite a few apps available. Obviously this doesn't compare with the quality of an Ipad Mini (except the sound on this may be better than Ipad mini 2 and similar to Ipad mini 4), but you are paying 1/3 of the price as well. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, like my mother is, this is a great little tablet. I purchased this to replace my mother's 3 year old Kindle Fire HD7. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the new one runs the newer apps much quicker."
2781,Electronics,1,"Purchased for my Father In Law - this was the most frustrating experience. Not user friendly - not friendly at all. Stick with a name brand tablet - Apple, Samsung, etc.. Avoid this device at all costs."
2782,Electronics,4,"I had the paperwhite, but this voyage is definitely better. The quality is better, screen is seamless with the edge, which makes it feel premium and delivers more comfortable reading experience. Lighter than the paperwhite, love the pressure sensors to change pages. Overall better experience reading experience than the paperwhite."
2783,Health & Beauty,2,"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box."
2784,Health & Beauty,5,Great product works just as good as the more expensive brands
2785,Electronics,4,Pretty sure he is probably playing angry birds with it now.
2786,Health & Beauty,2,Poor longevity.
2787,Electronics,1,"Certified garbage! Lesson learned about paying attention to reviews. Fire TV box and remote was packaged like new, even included new batteries. After plugging it in it would only show Amazon logo and 'unknown boot' on screen. Cycled power several times and even tried to reset using remote buttons, no dice. I read all the negative reviews before I purchased this, I chose to take the chance so I'm angry with myself, but very disappointed with Amazon for even suggesting this is refurbished, let alone certified, as if that means something."
2788,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect!
2789,Health & Beauty,4,"I have many AA battery operated things in my house. I use flameless candles that come on every night and stay on for 6 hours. I go through batteries. It was getting pretty expensive at the store. Found these, ordered them. Using them. They seem to be a high quality battery, unlike some others I have purchased only to have them last half as long. These are great!"
2790,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I purchased this tablet for my grandson who is 4 years old. He loves it!
2791,Health & Beauty,4,good buy
2792,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"The tablet itself was nice, but the screen was to small for books, videos, and minecraft."
2793,Health & Beauty,5,Great as expected. My third time buying these.
2794,Health & Beauty,3,Lots of batteries. Not a lot of battery life.
2795,Electronics,4,Great gifts!! Very much enjoyed by my family members.
2796,Electronics,2,"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
2797,Health & Beauty,1,"Bought these for my sisters day care. She said half of them did not work at all, were dead when received"
2798,Electronics,4,"I understood it did not have the wake command. But it would be better if it had it.Other than that, everything is wonderful with this speaker! Really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps, just ask Alexa and she plays the most recent episode!"
2799,Health & Beauty,2,"I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality."
2800,Health & Beauty,5,they are batteries as stated
2801,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"He figured it out in no time. Be sure to combine all non-child approved apps into a folder. My only complaint is the 1 year free Amazon Freetime doesn't work without an internet connection. Not everyone has home wifi. Anyway, that's my only complaint."
2802,Electronics,4,Great tablet for the price. Got this for a present and love it
2803,Health & Beauty,2,Not very long lasting batteries....
2804,Health & Beauty,2,Not great for remote control car.
2805,Health & Beauty,4,What can I say Thes batteries work as xpected.
2806,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Tap is the first step into making your home a smart home. It will act as a brain to everything else. Unfortunately, you'll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights, thermostat, locks, etc. to get the full potential out of it. Alone, it merely acts as a Bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone."
2807,Electronics,4,purchased as a gift but I do have the Echo. If the echo works like the Echo it will be great.
2808,Health & Beauty,5,Decent life for the price!
2809,Health & Beauty,5,Gift
2810,Electronics,3,"There's a lot of space with the Amazon Basics laptop and a number of great compartments, but the material it's made from feels kind of stiff and inexpensive. I was impressed at how much I could get into this backpack, but once it was packed it felt very big and bulky. My normal backpack is a smaller one from Timberline which has less compartments but seems to hold a great deal of stuff and not feel nearly as bulky as this one."
2811,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
2812,Health & Beauty,5,Good battery good price.
2813,Health & Beauty,5,Work well - would purchase again.
2814,Health & Beauty,5,Good price and last just about as long as any other brand I've used.
2815,Electronics,4,"First off, I‚Äôm primaril an Apple product user that chose this unit because of its price & child centered form factor. Price - compared to an iPad was - & form factor such as weight & resilience from being dropped from reasonable heights were definite strengths. The ability to discretely control access for a 2 to 4 users was also a plus. Relative down side for me has been counter intuitive user interface as compared to Apple products."
2816,Health & Beauty,5,"Non name brand batteries usually freak me out a little, but these actually work pretty well. I drain batteries pretty fast, and so far these hold up like Duracell."
2817,Electronics,2,"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
2818,Health & Beauty,5,Great Price.
2819,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries are good, but do not have the power and length of service as the copper top batteries. The main benefit is that they have not leaked and ruined my electronics like the copper tops do."
2820,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for the purpose of reading, also inexpensive"
2821,Health & Beauty,5,"Fast shipping. I haven't worn out one yet, so I dont know what their life will be, but they look good."
2822,Electronics,4,"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
2823,Electronics,4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
2824,Health & Beauty,5,"I'm glad I got these. Now, I don't have to run to the store when the batteries die."
2825,Health & Beauty,5,"What I found was that in our Wii controllers and Xbox controllers, the rechargeable packs would die after a few months (maybe last a year)...but then I would have spent so much on the packs that I wouldn't want to replace them, so they would stay in the charger longer and longer and when we wanted to play a game, we only got 10 minutes of play time until the rechargeable pack was dead.Then I bought batteries at Walmart (Duracell) and used those...but it was so long between changes that when we wanted to play a game 6 months later, only half the controllers worked! And I was out of batteries!Then I got an Amazon Dash button for these and now all that is gone. I put the box of batteries downstairs by the Xbox and Wii. No more dead batteries!!!! The batteries are in bundles of 4. When we get low, I'll just order another box. Best way to always keep batteries available for controllers, remotes, and such."
2826,Health & Beauty,5,Works well.
2827,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"The battery doesn't last as long as was advertised, if you have the money I would recommend the backlit model."
2828,Health & Beauty,4,"As far as value goes, I haven't seen any better for a pack of 100 batteries. We go through them in ridiculous amounts with the kids toys, like rc cars and other stuff. My son has magic tracks, and those little cars take 3 at a time and eat through batteries fast. I have noticed they don't hold a charge as long as my rayovac and duracell did, but you do get a ton for the price with these. I found them pretty comparable to the drug store off brand ones. I'll still be back for more of these when we run out, especially when Alexa has them as a deal."
2829,Electronics,1,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
2830,Health & Beauty,5,good
2831,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,I bought this for my son's girlfriend as a gift. She really likes it and has positive words.
2832,Health & Beauty,1,"I have no idea why these batteries are reviewed so well. I used them in a small LED keyboard light for my computer, and I had to change them weekly. Sure you get more batteries for less money, but in total I think you'd be better off buying a quality brand."
2833,Health & Beauty,5,High performance batteries.
2834,Electronics,4,"excellent gift, ok sound, great portability, would buy again"
2835,Health & Beauty,5,Good price
2836,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is an excellent product for kids. There are lots of games, books (including interactive ones) and cartoons. I also like you can set a time limit for how long you want your child to play or use the Fire. The only downfall is the charger cable sucks."
2837,Electronics,4,"We are used to iPads in our house. This has taken some learning to get used to a slightly different format, but it works great!! The price point is perfect for kids to use without the worry."
2838,Health & Beauty,1,"Utterly worthless, no staying power."
2839,Health & Beauty,1,Half of the batteries received were dead and there is no replace option.
2840,Electronics,4,"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
2841,Health & Beauty,5,seem to work well
2842,Health & Beauty,5,"good quality, fast shipping"
2843,Health & Beauty,4,pretty good batteries.
2844,Electronics,4,"This is perfect for my 3 year old. He loves this. The charger can be a little tricky at times, so I do have to be the one to plug it in. I've made sure to download a few of his favorite things on it for when we are offline & it's worked just fine. I will be buying an SD card soon to give him more room though, but we haven't run into any issues so far."
2845,Health & Beauty,5,AAA+
2846,Health & Beauty,3,Yep
2847,Electronics,4,interface isnt as user friendly as other brands but u get used to it.
2848,Electronics,4,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
2849,Health & Beauty,1,Run down very quickly!
2850,Electronics,4,"I waited to get this keyboard until I did a little bit of research, and I think that made all the difference. In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it. It's a perfect portable size, but it's not something I would want to store in a backpack. I will probably keep the box it came in for travel purposes."
2851,Electronics,4,I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
2852,Electronics,4,"The bag fits a 17.3 laptop quite snuggly, but it fits nonetheless. There is a considerable amount of space in each of the available sections, along several accessory pockets for those smaller items. The 2 mesh side pockets are big enough for a standard plastic water bottle, but not big enough for a nalgene water bottle.Taking it on a couple destinations so if there are any issues I find with it, I will edit my comments accordingly. As it stands now, good solid bag for the price and it does fit larger laptops."
2853,Health & Beauty,4,OK
2854,Health & Beauty,5,So far these are performing extremely well
2855,Health & Beauty,4,"The sole noticeable difference between these and the big name brands is price.Side by side, they work almost exactly as long as the copper tops. Which makes me wonder who makes these."
2856,Health & Beauty,4,"Great price, does the job. Used them to power BV Bicycle Light Set Super Bright 5 LED Headlight, 3 LED Taillight, Quick-Release. Gives very good light intensity, albeit first few uses. Can't yet vouch for how long these batteries last vs. Duracell."
2857,Electronics,4,Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
2858,Health & Beauty,5,Love these!
2859,Health & Beauty,3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
2860,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy
2861,Health & Beauty,1,Booooo
2862,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This tablet has been great for my three year old. Only complaint is that you can't turn off the app download function on free time or see a complete list of what has been downloaded.
2863,Electronics,4,"I bought this on super sale as an e-reader and to use to browse the web in lieu of a laptop when traveling. I found it to be a great value for the price. It processes rapidly on the web through its Amazon Silk browser. Streaming music also works well. The screen has nice resolution. It does not play well with other operating system apps and the apps available through Amazon does not compare to Google. I was unable to download a Google play app, although G mail works like a champ. The camera does not produce decent images. I wouldn't bother with that function. All in all a terrific buy for the money, but don't expect an iPad."
2864,Health & Beauty,5,They work
2865,Electronics,1,"the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech UE BOOM.the price is too high, even I got on promotion with $79"
2866,Health & Beauty,4,Havent used these batteries yet.
2867,Electronics,4,"The item is a great tablet for basic uses such as email, youtube, and facebook."
2868,Electronics,4,"Its a great set up for kids, my daughter loves it and plays it all the time."
2869,Electronics,4,"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
2870,Electronics,4,No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
2871,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries they batterize things
2872,Health & Beauty,5,Good price speedy delivery
2873,Health & Beauty,5,This is a great value considering they have been lasting a while under heavy use daily!
2874,Electronics,4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
2875,Electronics,4,This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
2876,Electronics,3,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
2877,Health & Beauty,5,Works great. Last as long as other brand names.
2878,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,"Would not take a charge, good thing i tried before wrapping it for Christmas."
2879,Health & Beauty,5,It's a battery what can I say
2880,Electronics,2,"I think I downloaded 6 new apps. I wait to surf the web. This thing is so slow to respond. My old refurbished iPad is better. I really only bought it to stream Hulu and Netflix. I'm not excited about lighting up the home screen to find advertisements every day, but I guess you get what you pay for. I wanted inexpensive, I got it! Don't buy this if you are used to using quick responding electronics."
2881,Health & Beauty,4,Ordered these for items i received from Amazon and they were packagedwell and preformed perfectly. Will definitely order moreAmazonBasics batteries. Da HYP
2882,Electronics,3,This does everything your smart phone does but with a larger screen for easier browsing and input.
2883,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries. they work FOREVER!
2884,Health & Beauty,5,they work. good price. as expected
2885,Health & Beauty,4,As expected
2886,Electronics,4,Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
2887,Health & Beauty,5,Work just as good as the name brands out there.
2888,Electronics,4,"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
2889,Health & Beauty,4,First time user seems comparable to EverReady
2890,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.
2891,Health & Beauty,5,I have a full load of batteries
2892,Health & Beauty,2,"The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them."
2893,Electronics,4,Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
2894,Health & Beauty,4,"Good Value for the amount of batteries you receive.Great for TV Controllers, basic items. Gaming Controllers eat through these rather quickly."
2895,Electronics,4,I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
2896,Electronics,1,Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
2897,Electronics,4,I've love kindles for years and was looking for a bit larger reading area. That is what I got and more. I very satisfied EXCEPT it just goes blank repeatedly and for no apparent reason stay on and I am back to satisfaction.
2898,Health & Beauty,2,"Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better."
2899,Electronics,4,I bought this for husband for Christmas. He loves it. It fits his needs perfectly. I would recommend this product.
2900,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries very week. Would Not Work IN Several devices.
2901,Health & Beauty,2,These do not hold charge for long.
2902,Electronics,4,I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
2903,Electronics,4,"I believe this' a great item, my sister has 1 and we liked it that's what prompt us to get one"
2904,Electronics,4,Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
2905,Health & Beauty,5,The Amazon batteries seems to have an acceptably long life compared to much more expensive brand names. My one complaint is that they recently upsized the box the smaller package was much more convenient to store the batteries in.
2906,Health & Beauty,2,Not great for remote control car.
2907,Health & Beauty,4,Great investment. I wouldn't rely on them in a high powered devices (even though I haven't tried them in anything other than computer mice and remote controllers) but I still have 90 of the batteries even after half a year of lying around. Great investment on batteries for when you need them.
2908,Electronics,4,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
2909,Electronics,4,We have an iPad but bought this for the kids unlimited prime content. We have enjoyed it and it has a lot that the iPad doesn't. The menu could be more friendly but I like the parental limits it has.
2910,Health & Beauty,4,They don't last as long as the brand name but are good enough considering they are much cheaper.
2911,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
2912,Electronics,4,Bought this to get the dual cameras AND THE EXPANDABLE STORAGE!!!!...love it for its size and other features. Battery life is good. Graphics and resolution good.
2913,Electronics,4,"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
2914,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one
2915,Electronics,4,I love the Amazon Tap. The sound is great and it's completely portable. It lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate. Excellent product for the money!
2916,Electronics,4,It was a gift for someone who is 10 and loves to read. She likes that she doesn't have to carry books
2917,Health & Beauty,5,good batteries for the price. i will order again
2918,Health & Beauty,5,"use these batteries specifically for amazon devices, they give long lasting performance."
2919,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,But the youtube app has so many ads it has the kids on all kinds of stuff.
2920,Health & Beauty,5,Seems to work like every other battery. Just less expensive!
2921,Health & Beauty,4,ok
2922,Health & Beauty,4,"As advertised, I have not had any problems."
2923,Electronics,4,"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
2924,Health & Beauty,5,For the price you can't get a better battery
2925,Health & Beauty,5,It was great
2926,Health & Beauty,5,great savings
2927,Electronics,4,A great watch. I bought it for the heart rate feature and it is pretty accurate.
2928,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Fire HD8 16GB is a excellent value and performs accordingly for it's price-point. It cannot be compared with a mini-ipad at a fraction of the price. The other drawback is the , limited apps as compared to the apple store or even google store. Yes, the google store can be loaded with a little difficulty. All in all for the money, it;s a nice little tablet."
2929,Health & Beauty,2,"They're cheap but we went through these in less than half the time of the previous pack of the same, which was Duracell. I was hoping the brand wouldn't matter but it seems that in this case, it does."
2930,Health & Beauty,5,Work Fine.
2931,Health & Beauty,5,cheap and are working great!
2932,Electronics,4,Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
2933,Electronics,4,The Fire HD 8 was a replacement for my grandsons Samsung tab 7. I was pleasantly surprised how nice this tablet is for the price. I would of gave it a 5 but it‚Äôs a little slow at times but don‚Äôt let that hold you back from purchasing this. Nice screen looks great with videos. Volume is a little weak but not bad.
2934,Electronics,4,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
2935,Electronics,4,"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
2936,Electronics,4,I bought this for my mom on her birthday. She loves it. It big enough and easy for her to navigate.
2937,Electronics,4,"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
2938,Health & Beauty,5,A value.
2939,Health & Beauty,5,great deal
2940,Electronics,2,"I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why"
2941,Health & Beauty,3,Great price but not long lasting in comparison to higher priced competitors. I got about 1/5 of the life I would with Duracell.
2942,Electronics,4,It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
2943,Health & Beauty,5,Great package.
2944,Health & Beauty,4,"Don't seem to last as long as Ray-o-vac but the price is right. My impression is subjective, I haven't done any controlled tests."
2945,Health & Beauty,5,Yay! The best price and great quality
2946,Health & Beauty,5,Bunch of AA batteries. Been working fine. Seems to be a good value.
2947,Electronics,4,We only use it for streaming Hulu and playing a few games but it's held its own so far.
2948,Health & Beauty,3,I buy a lot of these. I don't think that the longevity is exceptional but they are inexpensive in bulk. Worry about recycle maybe need to consider rechargeables
2949,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing so far. These AAA's are even more affordable than the brands at WalMart. Will update if they end up not being good.
2950,Electronics,1,"If adding more than one child to the account, the screen will not rotate properly for the second, third, or fourth child. Geek squad could not fix this problem, seems to be a manufacturer's issue. Also, there are too many adds. I returned this product."
2951,Health & Beauty,3,"For the price, you can't really go wrong. But they don'5 last long.The only problem is that the battery life is not long at all. If you are using these in a TV Remote (or similar remotes) they will last 3-4 months.If you use these in a flashlight or power toothbrush (or similar items), they only last about a month.It seems that these don't last long in items that you need to use daily for longer periods of time. But, if you are using these for a TV/STB Remote or a holiday decoration that plays music, they will last much longer (approx 3-4 months)."
2952,Electronics,3,"I like this tablet. I had a nook, the fire has more memory, bigger screen and lower price. The downside? The Amazon Fire is so ridiculously proprietary that I cannot watch any of my movies on it from my nook. This is becoming industry standard. Too bad."
2953,Health & Beauty,4,"What can I say... I need them, they work, and they're less expensive."
2954,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet to replace another one I had that ran to slow and had barely any storage space and so far so good! I've been using it for a few hours everyday for about a week and haven't had to recharge yet! The tablet runs quickly opening browsers and apps. It has more storage than my other tablet and has an SD card port. Even though it's an 8in screen it does it feel like it because the pictures are so vivid. So far the only thing I don't like is that you can't mirror or cast it to a TV or computer screen. Other than that it seems to work great.
2955,Health & Beauty,4,Much better quality than the Eveready batteries I normally purchase at a discount store. My telephone headset eats through batteries which is why I don't like to spend too much on them - the first time I used these batteries they outlasted them!
2956,Health & Beauty,1,Literally the worst battery I've ever had. I've used them in different types of products and they are DEAD WITHIN A WEEK every time. Go to the dollar tree and save yourself some money and a headache
2957,Electronics,4,Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
2958,Electronics,4,This is a replacement kindle my old one was a second generation this is a 7th generation really like it
2959,Health & Beauty,5,"good product, fast shipping"
2960,Electronics,4,"We bought this for our toddlers, and so far seems to hold up well with them. Some quirky rules with Amazon and accounts with product, but overall good for what we need."
2961,Electronics,3,OK for the price. Used for games and checking emails. Haven't explored other uses at this time
2962,Health & Beauty,5,Very good
2963,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever. They have a short life in every item I used them in. One example (but similar with all devices): I have a battery operated clock that needs the batteries changed every 3 years. I need to change these every three months. Will never purchase these again.
2964,Electronics,4,This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
2965,Electronics,3,Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
2966,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for kids! Very good size and light. Kids love it.
2967,Health & Beauty,5,Great
2968,Health & Beauty,5,Haven't had to use them yet but I am sure they will do the job!!!
2969,Electronics,4,Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
2970,Electronics,4,We use this for streaming and games. It is a great value for the money.
2971,Health & Beauty,5,good price and good stuff
2972,Electronics,4,very easy to set up and use. seems to be good quality
2973,Health & Beauty,2,"While most, modern day batteries no longer contain mercury, the Amazon basics battery line unfortunately does. Which means they're bad for the environment, and not able to be disposed of other than in appropriate hazardous waste. I'll spend the extra few dollars and buy a name brand"
2974,Health & Beauty,4,As advertised
2975,Health & Beauty,1,Just put them in 3 days ago and already dead. Going with the name brand next time.
2976,Electronics,4,"This was a gift for grandchildren. I am sure they will love, seeing they used the older one we have."
2977,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product, good price"
2978,Health & Beauty,1,Are not strong enough to work the remote to my smart tv. Not sure what I will use these for since they only last about two weeks in my other tv remote.
2979,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
2980,Electronics,4,Nice tablet for my one year old daughter...however we are still trying to find out how to operate tablet programs without wifi.
2981,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries. They work.
2982,Health & Beauty,5,reliable affordable
2983,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
2984,Electronics,3,Unable to download the Instagram app. which stinks
2985,Health & Beauty,5,A very good battery for the price.
2986,Health & Beauty,5,They're definitely good batteries! What a bargain. I recommend this if you have a lot of AAA toys.
2987,Electronics,1,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
2988,Electronics,4,Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
2989,Health & Beauty,2,"In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking."
2990,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries literally only last 15 minutes inside of each device I put them in. When I researched the product, they told me the only way was to spend 50 on the recharger for these batteries. I personally do not buy batteries to have to spend more than what I spent on them in whole to have to buy a whole other product to recharge them. Worst amazon product I ever wasted my money on"
2991,Health & Beauty,3,They didnt last as long as duracells
2992,Electronics,3,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
2993,Electronics,4,Bought a couple for my kids for xmass and they love them.
2994,Electronics,4,Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
2995,Electronics,4,"This is simple, well made and appears to be durable. The size means that I can sit in my favorite chair with my laptop. Other units that I have used were either larger than I wanted, or overly complicated and subject to breakage."
2996,Health & Beauty,1,Maybe I received a defective batch but these are so bad.No longevity at all. Used up within 2 weeks whereas the branded ones last 2 months!I will not purchase them again regardless of the lower cost.
2997,Electronics,4,Currently setting everything up on it but so far so good.
2998,Electronics,4,Pretty cool kids love it. Always adding things to my grocery list I didn't want.
2999,Electronics,3,"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
3000,Health & Beauty,5,Good product. Got it quickly.
3001,Health & Beauty,5,"Amazing Value, they shipped free on Amazon Prime and they are as good as any other."
3002,Health & Beauty,5,Product works as described. Great value.
3003,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought this for my 3 year old and it is great. Wish it had a bit more storage but overall very happy with my purchase.
3004,Health & Beauty,4,"So far, so good. They are what they are supposed to be. I will check back after using and see if they have long life. BTW, packaging is very good."
3005,Electronics,3,Bought this for my my daughter. Good for slower games. Kind of slow loading pages and when watching videos
3006,Health & Beauty,4,great for the price
3007,Electronics,4,This has a lot of great features for kids and for parents who want to protect them. My kids love having their own.
3008,Electronics,4,Great for media consumption. Screen seems sharp enough unless you get unbearably close to it. Wifi connectivity is good. Speakers sound poor but I didn't expect any better from an 80$ tablet. Have had this tablet since November and is still going strong. Only complaint is the slow charging. but it isn't too bad.
3009,Health & Beauty,4,"Arrived on time, battery doesn't last very long though even when fully charged, so that's my only concern."
3010,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead"
3011,Health & Beauty,1,I had to go through half of the box to find four batteries that work. Pay a little more for quality batteries that work.
3012,Health & Beauty,5,Can't beat the price!
3013,Health & Beauty,5,good product and will order more.
3014,Health & Beauty,1,BRUTAL! THEY DONT LAST LONG AT ALL!
3015,Health & Beauty,5,Work as good as Duracel and cost less. Not much else to say.
3016,Health & Beauty,5,"Great value, work as expectedFit as expected in devices"
3017,Electronics,4,"This tablet is perfect for my mom. She primarily uses it for playing games, the calendar and taking pictures. The camera is a decent camera for a 7"" tablet. Hopefully she'll use it to read books and magazines as well."
3018,Electronics,4,This speaker's forte is it's drop and charge ability. It does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with. The sound quality though is ok...Def not very loud and lacks the lows. But for a small portable speaker which is not expensive I would recommend it.
3019,Electronics,4,the reader is very compact so it can easliy fit into a bag or pocket. The auto light feature is also a plus.it takes a little bit to get adjusted to the side tabs and presume that future versions of this device will be improved upon.
3020,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries. They make small devices work. What more is there to say
3021,Health & Beauty,4,Good value here. They seem to last as long as the standard Duracell batteries that we used to buy.
3022,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,great tablet for kids with amazon bonuses. don't have to worry about what content my kid is accessing.
3023,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Great Tablet.Performs very well so far.Pictures and graphics are of very good quality.
3024,Health & Beauty,5,good
3025,Electronics,4,"I read a huge number of books in Kindle format. This Kindle Fire is perfect for that. It's just the right balance between screen size and easy carrying. It also is great for Audible users (you will want to install a micro SD card, though). You can also use it to watch Netflix and the like, although I don't. As a tablet, it leaves a lot to be desired. If you are looking for a tablet, give this a pass. It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that. Bottom line: if you just want a Kindle reading platform with some extra functionality, this will work well for you. If you're looking for the full Android tablet experience, look elsewhere."
3026,Health & Beauty,2,TERRIBLE! Barely lasted three hours during a digital camera shoot where Duracell lasts multiple days.
3027,Health & Beauty,4,great
3028,Health & Beauty,1,"absolute garbage, noteven a 1/4 of the battery of a regular energizer, dies so quick, tested, compared for months, sorry Not worth the money atany price, except maybe free."
3029,Electronics,3,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
3030,Health & Beauty,1,They don't work. Still to regular brands.
3031,Health & Beauty,2,batteries last a fraction of the time that most of the other well known battery brands do
3032,Health & Beauty,1,"Shortest battery life I have ever experienced, using a Microsoft BlueTooth mouse that I have had for years, and have never experienced a shorter time between changing batteries than with these Amazon batteries! Duracell even Energizer or Maxell are far superior given my long decades of experience. Bah Humbug to Amazon on this one."
3033,Electronics,4,My kids have enjoyed using this device. They have downloaded games and shows.
3034,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 3 year old daughter loves playing on her fire. The apps are all very entertaining and easy enough for her to use.The only thing I have had difficulty with is accessing youtube or the internet.
3035,Health & Beauty,5,Great value. I haven't had any problems with them.
3036,Health & Beauty,4,This is as good of a glove as you will find for the money. Be aware the when ordering they are extremely small if you normally wear a large an extra large will still be tight and need some break in time. Order at least one size bigger
3037,Health & Beauty,5,Very long lasting batteries for a great price
3038,Health & Beauty,2,One in every three of these has leaked battery acid in a matter of days l.
3039,Health & Beauty,4,good battieries
3040,Electronics,4,"Works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like, just found out it supports dish network"
3041,Electronics,4,"My daughter loves playing with this. There are so many features, that it keeps her busy."
3042,Health & Beauty,5,Good price and good product.
3043,Health & Beauty,4,Great item
3044,Health & Beauty,4,Not sure what else to say other than these are cheap batteries. Great price.
3045,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries are batteries these seemed fine for us! They lasted the whole Taylor Swift concert! Don't really know how long they last total.
3046,Electronics,4,just what I was looking for to putin my guest room. It has a good picture
3047,Electronics,1,Gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it..I want to buy one for myself....
3048,Electronics,4,she loves it she is 6yrs old and it fits her level well and she just loves it
3049,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
3050,Electronics,4,"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
3051,Electronics,4,"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
3052,Health & Beauty,5,best deal
3053,Electronics,4,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it."
3054,Electronics,4,"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
3055,Health & Beauty,5,These are done long lasting batteries. They work great
3056,Health & Beauty,5,Good Price
3057,Health & Beauty,4,Great. Works like any other battery.
3058,Health & Beauty,3,Don't last as long as Duracells.
3059,Electronics,4,"I bought this because it was 30.00 off for the early Black Friday sale and it doesn't need to be charged every day like my fire tablet. (Which is very annoying to have to stop reading because the battery is dying). This stays charged for days! This works great during the day and I bought a Energizer book light for 6.99 that clicks on it. The book light works just fine for night reading. Only con is the magazines I downloaded are not in color which I miss,so I will use for books only. I like the size and I able to carry it in my purse and read as I commute."
3060,Health & Beauty,5,great
3061,Electronics,4,"I bought it for friend of mine, he really liked it."
3062,Health & Beauty,5,FINE BATTERIES AT A WONDERFUL PRICE
3063,Health & Beauty,4,"not Great, not bad for the price"
3064,Health & Beauty,5,excellent value
3065,Health & Beauty,5,JUST AS EXPECTED
3066,Health & Beauty,5,great value
3067,Health & Beauty,4,"Exactly what it says basic haha, great product not the best, but definitely worth the price."
3068,Health & Beauty,5,Great price will be purchasing again!
3069,Health & Beauty,5,great inexpensive product which works wonderfully...
3070,Electronics,4,He loves electronics around Christmas so this was right up his alley! He loves telling Alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs
3071,Health & Beauty,5,good
3072,Health & Beauty,3,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.
3073,Electronics,4,Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
3074,Health & Beauty,1,"Had my first battery leak from the package. Installed batteries in November 2016 in house thermostat, so a fairly important device. Not sure when the leak began, but was discovered today (1/13/2017 - little more than two months later) after the furnace was running non-stop and house temperatures reached over 80 F. Checked the batteries and found one had leaked all over the contacts and battery holder in the thermostat."
3075,Electronics,3,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
3076,Health & Beauty,4,Produces DC voltage
3077,Health & Beauty,5,"Everything we have around the house uses batteries, so we go through them fast. I like purchasing in bulk because I don't have to purchase them as often and they are a little cheaper that way. I was a little nervous to purchase the AmazonBasics brand, because I wanted to make sure that I purchased a quality battery. We normally purchase Duracell.I am happy to see that the quality is just as good as the other brands we've purchase and at a fraction of the cost.We will be purchasing these again in the future."
3078,Health & Beauty,2,price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..
3079,Health & Beauty,5,Well worth it for the price..
3080,Health & Beauty,5,great Product
3081,Health & Beauty,4,good price...........batteries work
3082,Electronics,4,It is perfect as a secondary tablet for my son to take on the road.
3083,Electronics,4,"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
3084,Health & Beauty,5,great find great buy for all batteries
3085,Health & Beauty,5,BUY THE BEST OR SUFFER LIKE THE REST
3086,Health & Beauty,2,I bought these for remotes in my home. I'm constantly having to change them and sometimes the brand new batteries don't work.
3087,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet. I got it on Black Friday at an amazing price. The downside: a lot of features are only available to Amazon prime and audible members with an expensive membership fee and the selection of apps is limited. But on the other hand it‚Äôs inexpensive, the Alexa app is useful, games run ok, the display and photo quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to handle. For music and books I recommend an additional memory card - I use a 128GB - which works fine."
3088,Health & Beauty,4,Only time will tell if they leak like some many Duracells or Kirkland brand.
3089,Health & Beauty,5,You can't go wrong buying 48 double A batteries for 13 bucks.
3090,Electronics,4,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
3091,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries suck!!!!!!Stay away from them! Read bad reviews, they last only weeks."
3092,Electronics,4,Bought it for my wife who reads a lot of books. She loves it!!
3093,Electronics,4,"It is a good tablet, but is a little slow downloading apps"
3094,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I bought 2 of these tablets for my two youngest children. They had a lot of options to chose from as far as children apps go, but they were already familiar with the iPad since they stole mine all the time. Lol. That made it hard for them as well as myself to figure out how to use at first. Besides that, it's a good product."
3095,Health & Beauty,4,One of the best deals on batteries Ive ever gotten. I feel like they are just about as good as Duracell or Energizer but for this price you cant deny the value. Ill be buying Amazon batteries in bulk like this from now on. It's close enough to the major brands for me to switch and enjoy the value.
3096,Health & Beauty,5,Work great haven't replaced any yet!
3097,Health & Beauty,5,Product was as expected
3098,Health & Beauty,1,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
3099,Health & Beauty,4,"works fine. don't know if they are better than name brands, but they do job for me."
3100,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"Seemed to be fine as Chtistmas gift for granddaughter. However, today she reported that it wouldn't turn on or charge today. Supposed to have two year unconditional guarantee. Don't know where to take it."
3101,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries for the price, if u have kids this is the way to go"
3102,Health & Beauty,5,"Love this product.Excellent power for the money.Thank you very much,Mark S. Koslosky"
3103,Health & Beauty,4,good buy
3104,Electronics,4,Nice starter tablet for my nephew. Does what we need it to do.
3105,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Got it as a gift for my dad, so far so good.Didn't not realise the special offers are ads, spend more money to buy the one with out them.Also hate the fact they removed the wwan connection, you now need wifi to connect to the store."
3106,Health & Beauty,5,good pricing
3107,Health & Beauty,4,good value
3108,Electronics,4,Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
3109,Electronics,4,The battery charge life is extended and everything else is fine.
3110,Health & Beauty,3,Seems to work well
3111,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"It's a good tab for the kids, keeps them busy. Wish the speed was faster."
3112,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing!
3113,Electronics,4,My kids love the fact that it was very little and they could play with it
3114,Health & Beauty,2,Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
3115,Electronics,3,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
3116,Electronics,4,Will buy this product at this price range again if needed.
3117,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries wore out much too quickly. I almost replaced the weather station after it went through 2 sets of batteries in about 1 month. Luckily, something else with the same kind of batteries burned out the same day and I realized that the batteries were bad, not the electronics. ."
3118,Electronics,4,Quality product at a reasonable cost. Travels anywhere.
3119,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,There's not much difference in the regular Kindle. Wait till it goes on sale.
3120,Electronics,4,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
3121,Health & Beauty,4,I like the batteries. Seem as good as the main brands - However I do not understand why amazon has to use such wasteful packaging in a bulk box. Why pack it in sets of 4 when package is a box. It does not serve any role and just adds to landfills.
3122,Health & Beauty,5,"THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT ,,,,EXCELLENT ,,I WOULD RECCOMENT THIS TO EVERYONE,,C CHIANESE"
3123,Health & Beauty,4,"Was a Gift to-for Another...but, They Loved IT also!!....driggs, 1/17/16"
3124,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries do not last long. I put some in a portable can opener and was able to open about 10 cans.
3125,Electronics,4,Very pleased with the product and performance. Easy and fast to download content - such as movies and music. Took on a recent trip and now wished I had bought one sooner - fits right in back pocket of my DSLR camera bag. Only draw back was unexplained power loss - as described by other reviewers. After a day it came right back on - suggest it might be a recharging problem as after a full charge it is working fine again. For the price and content available - great buy.
3126,Electronics,4,I got this for my one and two year old girls and I don't have any complaints! The battery life isn't great but I don't really mind that!
3127,Electronics,4,"I love the product. I'm very happy but I would like even more if the page number was displayed when reading books on this tablet, in case I wanted to refer back to a certain page."
3128,Health & Beauty,4,Quite nice... last a reasonable time.
3129,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent.
3130,Health & Beauty,2,they dont last long at all not worth buying
3131,Health & Beauty,5,Such a great price. From what I can tell there are just as good as any other battery.
3132,Health & Beauty,5,Great value and price... Will be purchasing this again and recommending to others!!!
3133,Health & Beauty,1,I find these batteries fail in a short time on items like wireless thermometers and wall clocks. On an average changing is required within a month. I would not purchase these again.
3134,Electronics,2,It was too slow he didn't put any attention to it. Battery didn't last.
3135,Health & Beauty,4,Low costs batteries that work great with good extended lifetime.
3136,Health & Beauty,5,"I was skeptical at first, but these AmazonBasics batteries are pretty competitive to Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries."
3137,Health & Beauty,1,"I read a lot of reviews and convinced myself the AmazonBasics AA alkaline batteries were going to be a good buy. Nope. I put a pair in my TV remote, and within a month the TV was telling me to replace the batteries because of low power. I decided to check some new ones right out of the wrapper with my battery tester. 8 brand new batteries tested - all 8 in the red on the battery tester...not totally dead, but just inside the red. Next trip to Home Depot, I picked up the big pack of Energizer AA batteries and did the same test on them. 8 for 8 all in the green on my battery tester.Oh well, not worth crying about 13 worth of weak batteries. I am sure others have had great luck with the same AmazonBasics AA batteries. I just wanted to add my experience so others can make an informed decision. Good luck!"
3138,Electronics,4,"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
3139,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Thought this would be perfect for my two children. The case, warranty and pass to download unlimited apps seemed great. However, the pad is sometimes unresponsive and inaccurate-which can be frustrating for children. The case is a little too bulky. And it can be confusing for children who want to push an icon to play but it instead downloads. There is a definite learning curve that they will overcome in time but it could be more user friendly for younger users."
3140,Electronics,4,"I have purchased other tablets such as a kurio for kids and this is by far the best. It has all the apps you need as an adult, great for both adults and kids to read books and great visuals. Only bad thing like my old Kindle fire, the micro-usb portion gets loose."
3141,Electronics,1,"I didon't care for this tablet, downloading apps outside of Amazon was really confusing."
3142,Electronics,4,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
3143,Health & Beauty,4,"Decent longevity in electronics we use daily. In remotes they're fabulous, less so in more demanding electronics like games, cameras, and the half dozen Thomas trains my son loves. For the price in comparison to Duracell or Energizer you can't go wrong."
3144,Health & Beauty,1,Worst battery I've ever used. Lasts 1/3 as long as eveready!!!
3145,Health & Beauty,5,These are great batteries at a great cost. I will continue to purchase these. I replaced batteries in my outdoor solar lights and I have many and these work great. Highly recommend.
3146,Health & Beauty,5,A Great Deal On Great Batteries.
3147,Electronics,4,"This product was purchased for my son to use with another product that required this particular tablet. I think compared to other brands we have or have had this one is pretty good, easy to operate, and I like that the parent has to approve of the settings and games/activity for the child to use. I would however like to see this product allow google accounts to hook up with it so that way you can get stuff from google play on it that amazon store doesn't have!"
3148,Health & Beauty,2,The batteries came vacuum-sealed in packs of 4 in this really heavy/annoying plastic.
3149,Health & Beauty,2,These are so wasteful!! Rechargeable batteries are so much better!! The Amazon rechargeable ones are awesome!! And you can use and reuse and recharge and reuse them again and again and again and AGAIN!!
3150,Electronics,3,I bought it and wrapped it up immediately. So I couldn't say either way if it was good or not.
3151,Electronics,4,Very happy with the Tap. We have the Echo and would have to unplug it and plug it in to use it on the deck. With the Tap we just take it off the charging stand and go. No more bothering with Bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the Internet with TAP.
3152,Electronics,3,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."
3153,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries seem to die quickly.
3154,Health & Beauty,1,They do not last at all! I never leave negative reviews as I am generally satisfied. But logged back in just to do it! They are awful!!!
3155,Health & Beauty,5,"Very good, thanks!"
3156,Health & Beauty,5,"hey, they're batteries. They do what they are suppose to do."
3157,Electronics,4,The features that I found on the Fire tablet far exceeded my expectations. Well worth the purchase price.
3158,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,The product is very light and thin. But it doesn‚Äôt have built in light.
3159,Health & Beauty,5,Get tired of running out of batteries. Hope these last a while. Good product
3160,Electronics,4,My son loves his new tablet. He is 5 years old. Great feature of having kids games downloaded already.
3161,Electronics,4,Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
3162,Health & Beauty,4,good product
3163,Health & Beauty,3,"Pros: You can get a LOT of batteries for a very cheap price!Cons: Batteries do not last very long at ALL!I don't mind changing out batteries on something I use constantly since I got the hundred back, but it can get a little annoying doing it once a week. I bought these specifically for my XBox One controller which is used daily for an hour or two on average."
3164,Health & Beauty,5,This is such a good value
3165,Health & Beauty,5,good as any name brand
3166,Electronics,3,The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.
3167,Health & Beauty,4,Seems as good as all the major AA's to new to really rate...
3168,Health & Beauty,5,Last enough and great for the price
3169,Health & Beauty,4,OK
3170,Electronics,4,"great if you want to read, watch a show, catch up on email, or casually browse the internet."
3171,Electronics,3,Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
3172,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift. This is the 4th fire tablet ive purchased. Very well made product. Battery life is good. Does averything a tablet is supposed to do..
3173,Health & Beauty,5,Very gooood!!!
3174,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome batteries and Awesome price!
3175,Electronics,4,The only problem I have with this is slow boot up time
3176,Electronics,4,I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
3177,Electronics,4,"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
3178,Electronics,4,"I had an Apple Mini Ipad that was an older version and ran very slow due to older version OS I was told. I bought the Fire to replace it since I mostly use it for gaming through my WIFI. It was way cheaper and does everything I wanted and is very fast. No issues waiting for uploads. It has all the other features as well like weather, camera , and I have started to use Alexa and that is great."
3179,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
3180,Electronics,4,While it is not perfect and can be slow at times it is a good value for the price.
3181,Health & Beauty,1,DO not buy this product I've received this product to replace batteries in remote-control candles all three candles did not work I was ready to discard the candles when I decided to try different batteries. As soon as I put the different batteries from another company the candles worked fine. Tried to find a place to write to the seller but couldn't so apparently I'm just stuck for the price of the batteries which are useless!!!!!
3182,Health & Beauty,5,They work. They last!
3183,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
3184,Health & Beauty,5,great price
3185,Health & Beauty,1,"Batteries used in fire remote, lasted maybe a week and then died"
3186,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!!
3187,Health & Beauty,2,They for really fast
3188,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Very light, not feel like an electronics, feel like reading a book. Wish I got the white one."
3189,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal on batteries
3190,Electronics,4,"Great for the price, lots of functionality.recommend for the avid ebook reader"
3191,Health & Beauty,4,"a couple of low juice ones, but I bought a charger and all is good"
3192,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I purchased this Kindle for my wife because her Kindle Fire gives off too much glare to use in sunny conditions. Besides being able to use it while riding in the car during daytime, the biggest advantage she found is that it is significantly lighter than the Fire. Since she reads for hours on end that is a big plus. The main drawback is that the graphics aren't as clear with this reader. All in all, it was money well spent."
3193,Electronics,4,Love my Kendal but cannot find a case or screen saver for it.
3194,Electronics,3,It's unfair for me to rate this product cause I have not even taken it out of the box to set it up.
3195,Health & Beauty,5,Every battery had a voltage reading between 1.61 and 1.66v. Will update if the lifespan of these batteries is less than expected.
3196,Health & Beauty,4,Lasts longer than Rayovac. Pkg did have 1 defective battery.
3197,Health & Beauty,4,"in my eyes, they die to quickly"
3198,Electronics,4,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
3199,Electronics,4,I got this tablet so I wouldn't have to pack up my laptop when I went to my boyfriend's when I want to do my online class. This is perfect for that
3200,Electronics,4,"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
3201,Health & Beauty,4,Previously purchased and used these batteries. They last longer than other store brand. Worth the money.
3202,Electronics,4,"I love that this is a real adult tablet with kids programming installed. Biggest downfall is that my son has trouble switching from app to app, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. The pull up menu eat the bottom isn't very responsive to his little hands."
3203,Electronics,4,"Hands down the best ereader available. I researched several devices and it came down to the Paperwhite and the Voyage. There is a pretty hefty price premium for the Voyage. Most people will probably be very satisfied with the Paperwhite. I typically need reading glasses to read regular size print. On an eReader the font can be adjusted to make it large enough so I don't need to use the glasses. That means less text on each page and many more page turns. The physical ""buttons"" hep make the page turns easier and extra light brightness helps to add contrast to the text. These were enough to sell me on the Voyage. It was the right decision and I love the device."
3204,Electronics,4,I have really enjoyed it so far. While not perfect by any means it is certainly worth the price.
3205,Health & Beauty,5,Great THX
3206,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy
3207,Health & Beauty,5,Best value ever. Work just as good as all the other battery brands.
3208,Health & Beauty,2,Bummed. These batteries do not last long! Good for things like a clicker or something that isn't used often but we used these for Xbox one controller. With maybe 2 hours usage a day I've had to switch them out once a week.
3209,Health & Beauty,5,I use a lot of batteries and these work very well
3210,Electronics,4,Great tablet! My son really likes it to read and also to play games!
3211,Health & Beauty,4,good
3212,Health & Beauty,5,Great product works great
3213,Health & Beauty,4,great price and now I have them on hand whenever I may need a battery!
3214,Electronics,4,"Can't beat the price, it looks and feels nicer than my samsung tablet. I bought this as a gift, but I am thinking about getting one for myself."
3215,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
3216,Electronics,4,This is a gift for my great grandchildren ages 4 & 7 years.
3217,Electronics,4,Good age appropriate learning tool for kids. There is a variety of apps kids can download to keep them from getting bored. Overall a good tablet for the kids.
3218,Health & Beauty,1,"I am disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my Dad, delivered to him in October, 2015. I am visiting, and just opened the brand new package, and inserted 4 of them to run his blood pressure cuff. The machine worked, but the battery indicator showed low, I switched the batteries with other brand new amazon batteries - same reading. Then I switched with another set of name brand batteries, and the battery indicator showed high/full. If I was home, I would have used my battery meter. No 10 year shelf life - not even a 10 month shelf life. Amazon, I am usually one of your biggest fans, but not this time."
3219,Electronics,4,"It does what I need it to do, but a few to many apps that are not needed."
3220,Electronics,4,Great ereader. Light and easy to use. Only issue is a bit pricey.
3221,Health & Beauty,1,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
3222,Health & Beauty,5,"great price, very good batteries"
3223,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
3224,Electronics,4,Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
3225,Electronics,4,pretty fast and reliable the video quality is great
3226,Health & Beauty,3,I'm super charged over the price of these batteries!!!!
3227,Electronics,4,This is a quick and responsive tablet. Apps are limited to The Amazon store for the most part so it's important to make sure the apps you want are both available on Amazon and compatible with this tablet.
3228,Electronics,4,My son uses the device to help him do his homework
3229,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are as good or better than any brand of alkaline battery on the market today.
3230,Health & Beauty,5,Compared to dollar store like batteries these seem to be better but not like twice as good. For the price and quantity it's worth the purchase.Use them in tv remotes to chess computers to kids toys and can't complain. Amazing how many items require AA batteries today.
3231,Health & Beauty,5,"Packaged very well,just what I wanted."
3232,Electronics,3,It is the top of the line e reader by amazon which is also the leader in e readers. The voyage is an excellent device and very versatile to carry on your trips. I feel the premium for the page turn sensors is little too high. In hindsight I would go with the paper white and save a few bucks.
3233,Electronics,3,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
3234,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
3235,Health & Beauty,2,They simply do not last very long. Not worth the money.
3236,Health & Beauty,5,Good price.
3237,Health & Beauty,5,"they're batteries. nothing special to say, as they worked as they were supposed to : )"
3238,Electronics,1,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
3239,Health & Beauty,5,I love AmazonBasics in general and this number of batteries at that price- you cannot even beat that at the dollar store even with their crappy low quality batteries.
3240,Health & Beauty,5,"For years I purchased regular brand name batteries from local retailers. As these seemed to be a deal I purchased a pack. They seem to work just as well as the name-brands, just at a cheaper cost."
3241,Electronics,4,"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
3242,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch. Luckily Amazon is really good about giving refunds, so this is more a warning about not wasting your time on these."
3243,Electronics,4,my son loves it and is easy to use and has parental controls so he can't buy stuff without permission
3244,Electronics,4,"I would like to say that it's a great tablet, just too small(will buy bigger one next time!!)"
3245,Health & Beauty,4,Great to have as a backup
3246,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries were affordable and work well.
3247,Health & Beauty,5,Good price.
3248,Health & Beauty,5,As stated
3249,Electronics,4,Camera build to be improved.. play store needs more apps
3250,Health & Beauty,3,they DO NOT last as long as Duracell or Energizer.
3251,Electronics,3,I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
3252,Electronics,3,"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
3253,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
3254,Health & Beauty,5,What a great deal!
3255,Electronics,4,Works well and looks great for kids. Limited internet access though.
3256,Electronics,2,The charging plugs on these kindle damage way to easy. I am very disappointed as this is not the first time this has happened to one of my kindles.
3257,Health & Beauty,5,Great performance for the price
3258,Electronics,4,"After dropping my Kindle with a keyboard (not techie enough to know which generation it was) I did plenty of research before getting my next Kindle.I wanted a dedicated ebook as I don't want distractions when I read. Let's make this simple:I have read in sunlight and there have been no problems with glare.The automatic light makes it great for night reading.It took a while to get used to the buttons, but after my last Kindle, this was a feature I really wanted. I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either. I do like this more than my last Kindle, so that is all that really matters."
3259,Electronics,4,Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
3260,Health & Beauty,3,They don't last long.
3261,Electronics,3,I hate amazon app store. Nothing good in there. The tablet is too slow for what I do... it is good for reading only....
3262,Electronics,2,"Loved my husbands 4th generation disappointed in my 5th generation. 4th generation has 2 speakers and sound is much louder than the current 5th generation. I purchased this expecting the same quality in sound, or better, since I use the kindle to watch my TV shows."
3263,Health & Beauty,5,As good as any other at a good price!
3264,Health & Beauty,4,decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
3265,Electronics,4,Got this for my niece for Christmas and she loved it.
3266,Health & Beauty,2,"Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my Roku controller, Family Dollar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l"
3267,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Fast delivery.
3268,Health & Beauty,4,Work fine Good price.
3269,Health & Beauty,5,"great quality, price and convenient to have available at all times"
3270,Electronics,4,I love to buy stuff at best buy Most of the employees are great at helping With everything i needEspecially JISSELA
3271,Electronics,4,"I was unable to connect my Ring app and my ecobee app. Furthermore I‚Äôm more invested in the Apple ecosystem than with amazon. I returned this tablet for that reason. It worked well, and and would have been great long term but this one simply came down to personal preference"
3272,Electronics,4,"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use"
3273,Electronics,3,"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy."
3274,Health & Beauty,4,hard to find a better deal then this
3275,Health & Beauty,2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
3276,Electronics,4,Best budget tablet out there. Hasn't everything you need for someone who uses a tablet here and there.
3277,Health & Beauty,4,Not sure what I can say about batteries
3278,Electronics,3,"We purchased the Fire for our 9 year old. The price is right for an entry level device and I don't worry too much about it breaking. The charging port has already started to fail, however."
3279,Health & Beauty,5,Work great - we always restock with Amazon!
3280,Health & Beauty,3,These don't work for any decent amount of time! Stick with the name brand
3281,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
3282,Health & Beauty,5,great value
3283,Health & Beauty,2,Batteries didn't last a year. Last several batteries were dead.
3284,Electronics,3,Too small for 17 he envy very tight fit. Otherwise great product
3285,Health & Beauty,2,Several batteries don't work.
3286,Health & Beauty,5,wow
3287,Health & Beauty,1,I tried recharging them right out of the box and it says they are bad! I'll by my rechargeables elsewhere
3288,Health & Beauty,5,"Great performance, great price. Thank you Amazon"
3289,Health & Beauty,4,These are AA batteries and they work. They do seem to die a bit faster in my Speedlight then duracells but maybe I just use it more since I have the 48 pack.
3290,Electronics,4,Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
3291,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
3292,Health & Beauty,5,Good very good
3293,Electronics,4,Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
3294,Electronics,4,Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
3295,Electronics,4,I purchased this so my daughter could read her online books. Perfect size!
3296,Electronics,4,"This was bought as a replacement to a shattered screen kindle. We are always happy with our kindle but can i just tell you how easy it was to set up the replacement!?!? Literally no strain on the brain, follow screen instructions and EVERYTHING from old kindle transferred over flawlessly! Awesome!"
3297,Health & Beauty,5,"Yup, a bunch of batteries."
3298,Health & Beauty,4,to early to tell but like the price
3299,Health & Beauty,5,good
3300,Electronics,3,Speakers stuck on this thing . I bought it to give to my grandma but she found it too difficult.
3301,Health & Beauty,5,VERY price-effective.
3302,Health & Beauty,1,I ordered AA
3303,Health & Beauty,3,Wish I had opened the package all the way as soon as I received it because several of the batteries had leaked and caused corrosion on several more. Learned one this time.
3304,Health & Beauty,5,"So far these batteries are perfect. I put a fresh set in my electric toothbrush and thought my teeth were going to buzz out of their sockets. Not really, but they do seem to have more 'juice' than the national brands, if that is possible."
3305,Health & Beauty,5,"They work just fine. No complaints, go batteries!"
3306,Health & Beauty,5,As good or better than any major brand out there.The price is a fraction of what the major brands are.Time will tell what the durability is.This proves what a rip off battery prices are from the major brand manufacturers.
3307,Electronics,4,This tablet it will do the job but mostle for games videos YouTube etc is really slow so if you are looking for somthing fas skip this tablet
3308,Health & Beauty,4,"When I ran out of AA batteries, I of course came to Amazon to purchase more. As I am on a tight budget, I decided to go with the AmazonBasics brand. When they arrived, I immediately replaced the batteries in my Xbox controller. I noticed that the batteries did not last as long as the more popular name brands. (i.e. Duracell, Energizer, etc.) This is the only reason I have rated the product with 4 stars instead of 5. Everything else about these batteries is great. I am getting low already and will probably order them again."
3309,Health & Beauty,2,"I purchased a box of 48 AA batteries and the first 2 that I tried to use were dead the other 2 in the blister 4 pack worked fine, but a 50 failure rate is unacceptable. I will update how the rest of the box works as I try to use them. I will purchase a name brand next time."
3310,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome.
3311,Health & Beauty,3,"I hate running out of batteries so I bought this giant pack. It's a good value and the batteries seem to have plenty of juice for normal, non-hardcore activities (TV remotes, flashlights, that kind of thing). I haven't tried them in any high-power devices like digital cameras or remote control cars not sure if they would be the best choice in that case.Edit: they do not last as long as Duracells or Energizers"
3312,Health & Beauty,5,"I purchased this product for my own use, and Ive found it to be a great product. Size, fit, quality and the whole mess is top notch. I have to admit I was a little hesitant at first, given the price, but after opening the box I immediately realized I had made a good purchase. I can imagine using this item for a long time, and should I need another Ill likely buy one just like this."
3313,Electronics,4,Very kid friendly especially with 2 younger siblings. Bright color is fun and easy to find
3314,Health & Beauty,3,The battery life was not as long as Duracell and energizer.
3315,Health & Beauty,5,A++++
3316,Health & Beauty,5,As expected
3317,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and fast shipping!
3318,Electronics,4,It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
3319,Health & Beauty,1,"Im sure these are fine batteries, but they never arrived, and theres no way for me to request a replacement."
3320,Health & Beauty,5,"I used to use Duracells all the time, and then started having leakage problems with them. I ventured out to try these. Life seems to be as long in devices I use a lot, and they don't leak. I am done with Duracell, and will use these!"
3321,Health & Beauty,5,Best price i've come across
3322,Health & Beauty,5,"BEST BATTERIES EVERSeriously, way better than the two big brands that I have been buying for years.My insulin pump goes through one of these every 1.5 months were an energizer battery lasts .75 months"
3323,Health & Beauty,5,good for the cheap price
3324,Electronics,3,Son loves it........................................
3325,Electronics,4,Got this for my wife. She uses it daily to read She really lokes it.
3326,Electronics,4,"Got this for my9 year old so he could play mine craft and other little games. Does well, durable and easy to operate."
3327,Health & Beauty,5,"For the price,they are well worth it."
3328,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I bought this for my 6yr-old & am impressed w/the 1yr subscription to free-time that was included, and the additional 2yr manufacturer warranty. The actual tablet is very easy for my daughter to use, and am very happy for the parental options. Also think included apps are helpful. Really like the additional user options, so anyone can have their separate preferences set up. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because since purchasing the charging area on the tablet doesn't hold the cord at all and is always constantly falling out which is extremely frustrating!"
3329,Health & Beauty,3,"Batteries are great, price isn't the best. I've seen similar packs of generic batteries for cheaper. Wegmans comes to mind.."
3330,Electronics,4,I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
3331,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I love how easy the parental controls are and how easy it is for me to go back forth between my kindle page and to my sons
3332,Health & Beauty,1,Hardly last as long as a stick match. Total waste of money.
3333,Health & Beauty,4,"Capacity is a little light on these, but the price is awesome."
3334,Health & Beauty,4,"Have only installed a couple at this time. I have had other batteries brands that would last, but has acid leaks that sometimes damaged items."
3335,Health & Beauty,4,They are a good product for the price.
3336,Health & Beauty,5,great.
3337,Health & Beauty,5,"Cheaper, because generic, and works."
3338,Electronics,4,Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
3339,Health & Beauty,5,These are the only batteries I buy...
3340,Electronics,3,Only good for kids and games. Battery life is good.
3341,Electronics,4,Got this for my teenage son (17) so that he could give his eyes and neck a rest from looking at media on his iPhone 7+ He totally loved it!
3342,Health & Beauty,5,"Don't know why I waited so long to finally invest in rechargeable batteries. Once you switch, you won't go back!"
3343,Health & Beauty,4,Nice A+
3344,Health & Beauty,5,Works just as well as Duracell - just half the price
3345,Electronics,4,"I bought this primarily for videos for my son while in the car. I have messed around with it a bit and found the internet connections to be a bit slow. Its to be expected for a tablet at this price point. Overall, I am happy with the product."
3346,Electronics,4,"Easy to use, size is just right. Easy for my wife to travel with and carry in her purse."
3347,Health & Beauty,1,Half the box did not work and one set of 4 started leaking white battery acid within 5 minutes of putting it my sons toy. Asking Amazon for a full refund.
3348,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
3349,Health & Beauty,5,very good items!!
3350,Electronics,3,Battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good. Alexa is not as 'smart' as the marketing would like you to think. I get a lot of 'I don't know the answer to that'
3351,Health & Beauty,2,Very nice looking in picture and from a distance but the clock itself is cheaply made....The actual clock mechanism stopped working twice and doesn't work at all now.
3352,Health & Beauty,2,"WTH!! Went through these extremely fast - it seems there were many DUDS filtered in with a few good batteries!! by the time I realized this, it was over thirty days, so live and learn."
3353,Health & Beauty,4,"Havent tried yet but with so many, they may die before we use them all. Life time supply."
3354,Health & Beauty,5,Good price
3355,Electronics,4,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
3356,Electronics,4,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos."
3357,Electronics,4,Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
3358,Electronics,4,"With a price tag of 59.99, this is one of the low-end tablets with a lot of features, but is certainly worth its price tag. But it definitely lacks the features and HD display of its high end variant Fire HD."
3359,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
3360,Health & Beauty,3,OK for AAA needs
3361,Health & Beauty,4,Great price for good performance.
3362,Health & Beauty,5,"Super cheap, super good."
3363,Health & Beauty,4,OK
3364,Health & Beauty,4,Great batteries at a price that cannot be beat! I've used these now for a few months and they last just as long as the big name brands. No complaints!
3365,Electronics,4,"A little more complicated than my original kindle, but I lIke it."
3366,Health & Beauty,5,Worked as expected great value
3367,Health & Beauty,4,I see reviews of these batteries mostly on one end of the spectrum or the other. I love em' or I hate em'. Seems leakage is the culprit in bad reviews. I have had no problems with the AA size batteries I ordered.
3368,Electronics,4,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
3369,Health & Beauty,5,Buen producto.
3370,Health & Beauty,4,working great so far
3371,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and Super convenient
3372,Electronics,4,It is a better tablet then the rest better reviews and a good price
3373,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
3374,Health & Beauty,5,As always...reliable and well packaged.
3375,Electronics,4,granddaughter loves it! Now my Ipad if free for ME to use
3376,Health & Beauty,1,What went wrong These are the worst AAA batteries I've ever purchased. Make that the worst batteries ever purchased. I've used over half of them so far and I'm getting about 25 of the life I previously got from Duracell and other brand names.
3377,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries,.."
3378,Electronics,4,"I already have the Amazon Echo so this was just an additional one for my office. I think these gadgets are great. Set alarms, timers, get your local weather and who won the game last night. It can do too many things for me to list. It's great for everything however not great for music. I do listen to my local radio station on it - but compared to its' BIGGER brother Echo the sound is not that good."
3379,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought these for my grand children for Christmas and they have thoroughly enjoyed using their 'tablets' and the apps that can easily be saved on the tablet.
3380,Health & Beauty,4,Great item for the price and found they last just as long as top named batteries out there. Can never have too many spare batteries around in case of emergency.
3381,Health & Beauty,5,Very dependable
3382,Health & Beauty,5,Good price. Good product. Would buy again.
3383,Electronics,4,"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
3384,Health & Beauty,5,"I don't know what you expect to read here. Some elaborate review about how these batteries are amazing from the packaging to the ease of installation etc No, they are AS A batteries that are cost effective and do their job properly. No.magic smoke yet so can't complain. 10/10"
3385,Health & Beauty,4,works as you would think..grat price
3386,Electronics,4,"The tablet is easy to use, The storage isn't great but you can add a card for extra storage which is nice. Haven't found any problems with it yet. Reasonably price."
3387,Health & Beauty,3,"I almost reviewed these right when I got them, which was around October 6, 2015. It is now November 9th - just put 12 of these in four separate Hallmark Christmas figurines that each operate on three AAA batteries. Two stopped working within an hour and when I put new batteries in them, they worked fine - I think these just don't last and are not the best batteries. Just fyi. I am going to order some separate AAA batteries as I don't think these are great quality."
3388,Health & Beauty,4,"The batteries are fine, but the fact it defaults to a subscription sale is rally wrong, IMHO."
3389,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT PRICE.
3390,Health & Beauty,2,These have been the worse batteries. I've bought these before and didn't have a problem but this batch doesn't even last a month.
3391,Health & Beauty,4,"I looked at the math about the capacity and strength and longevity of different batteries and a lot of them are similar, including these, and these make the most sense price wise.I have tried HUNDREDS of rechargeable batteries and they get recharged a couple of times and then disappear. At a certain point they are just a waste of money."
3392,Health & Beauty,4,Good value.
3393,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet for kids with lot of good contents and Amazon's 2 year No-Questions asked warranty along with a free one year subscription for contents made it even better. Parental control on this is great, both us as parents and my son love this device. The only drawback I see is that the charging cable is very small length that it's hard to charge it without putting it on top of something to reach to a regular height outlet."
3394,Health & Beauty,5,Quality batteries for a decent price.
3395,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
3396,Health & Beauty,4,"If you're looking for cheap but durable batteries look no further. I personally like amazon products. I know I can count on them as much as a named brand, but for a 1/4 of the price. I got these on Prime day for a great price and the last a OK amount of time. I used them on my xbox controller, but i think it soaked up more power than I thought so the batteries died with in a month or so. Its not like I keep track, but noticing the controller shutting off was what lead me on to the life of the batteries. I have enough to last me a year or so. Again, good buy. If you're looking to save money from the expensive name brands, go with a Amazon brand product its becoming more common and competitive as a name brand product."
3397,Health & Beauty,1,amazon sucks these batteries drain like the water in my toilet
3398,Health & Beauty,4,"So far, so good! Works and last as well as the most expensive named brand."
3399,Health & Beauty,3,One of my 48 batteries arrived with what looks like a leak. The rest look fine so I'll just keep them. Otherwise these batteries work just fine.
3400,Electronics,4,I like this product but have problems with it turning itself on when just charging it. also several times it shut down and I had to go to reinstall factory settings losing my stuff. Alot of new options I do not use but several of my friends like.
3401,Health & Beauty,5,Wonderful staple to have in your home. My go to battery source.
3402,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
3403,Health & Beauty,5,These are okay by me.
3404,Electronics,4,Got it as a gift and they loved it. Was told it works great and very efficient.
3405,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Grandson became board with what it offers. Plug wears out fast
3406,Health & Beauty,5,"Haven't noticed any difference in performance since I switch from my (brand name), big difference in price though. I will be ordering these from now on."
3407,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet for my 4 year old granddaughters birthday and she loves it. Works well and it is easy for her to operate.
3408,Health & Beauty,5,Quality as expected
3409,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
3410,Electronics,4,Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
3411,Electronics,4,This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
3412,Electronics,4,My nephew likes the 'large' size of the Fire tablet as it's significantly larger than his phone.
3413,Electronics,4,I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
3414,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries did not even last a day with some LED lights we used. I do not recommend these to anyone. Go with a good brand name.
3415,Health & Beauty,5,I'm never going to buy a brand-name battery again . Amazon basic batteries are just as good as the big boys . Amazon basic batteries are my battery of choice from now on .
3416,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries do not last long at all as compared to Energizer. After 4 days of use they were no good anymore. The Energizer batteries have last me two weeks so far when using for the same thing. I will be using far more batteries so it really isn't a money saver. Disappointed!
3417,Health & Beauty,5,They work well
3418,Health & Beauty,3,i meant to order AA and not AAA.I shall reorder
3419,Health & Beauty,4,They don't last as long as name brands. You save money ...that's all.
3420,Electronics,2,My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
3421,Electronics,3,Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
3422,Electronics,2,Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load
3423,Health & Beauty,2,Doesn't last long.
3424,Electronics,4,"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
3425,Electronics,4,Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
3426,Electronics,4,"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
3427,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
3428,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries are just as good as the name brands.
3429,Health & Beauty,4,Seems great. Not sure long lasting life is good.
3430,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome price and works just as good as the well known name brands.
3431,Health & Beauty,4,"Work fine, very good price, good batteries! Word to the wise check the good to date on the Batteries, if possible! Some places lower the prices when close or past good to date. Past a good chance or bad of leakage."
3432,Health & Beauty,5,works well
3433,Electronics,4,"I had been looking for a smaller tablet. The new Fire HD8 is the perfect fit. It's great for media of all types. It's even a pretty good gaming device. But keep your expectations in check. It won't do everything a full laptop can, but it's not supposed to. The screen is terrific, although you may need to download an app for white balance adjustment."
3434,Electronics,3,The HD tablet is just right for a child who is being introduced to the computer word.
3435,Health & Beauty,4,"great product, great transaction"
3436,Health & Beauty,5,Nice product for a good price.
3437,Health & Beauty,5,Great item with great price
3438,Health & Beauty,5,Lots of batteries and great price for the money.
3439,Health & Beauty,5,"Cheap, long lasting batteries. Can't beat it."
3440,Health & Beauty,1,Not good. Don't last a week.
3441,Health & Beauty,5,Love it!
3442,Health & Beauty,3,works like any another.
3443,Health & Beauty,5,Delivered earlier and I am very satisfied! ! Will purchase again
3444,Health & Beauty,1,"Lasted for barely any time at all. I have no idea why some batteries last longer than others but I can attest that these were stored in the exact same condition in our home as another brand of battery and the Amazon ones lasted for far less than half the life of the namebrands. I'm always willing to give Amazon products a try, but these batteries left a lot to be desired."
3445,Electronics,3,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
3446,Health & Beauty,5,I am 100 satisfied with my purchase of these batteries
3447,Electronics,4,User friendly. Lightweight. Easy for the kids to use. Fast start up. 4 year old operates it easily. Didn't get 5 stars because it was broken in less than a month. Buy the warranty if it's for a child.
3448,Electronics,4,"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
3449,Electronics,4,Cannot beat the value and features that this product offers for the low price point.
3450,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect for such a low price!
3451,Electronics,4,This was to replace an earlier gen Kindle. That one would just shut down. We have not had any concerns with this and I will say I like the design better.
3452,Electronics,2,Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
3453,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal and last as long as the major brands
3454,Electronics,2,Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.
3455,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
3456,Health & Beauty,2,I bought these to use in the wireless mouse I bought at same time. I seem to have to change the batteries to often.
3457,Health & Beauty,3,Only reason is I meant to get AAA not AA :(
3458,Health & Beauty,1,these batteries died very quickly when compared to energizer or Duracell. Spend a little more and get a lot more battery life.
3459,Electronics,4,This tablet is great. Love the ease of use and the display is vibrant
3460,Electronics,4,"I purchased this during the black friday sale. I'm happy with the overall product with the exception of two things.1.) the auto brightness control is not good enough for me, its either too bright or too dark. I can't figure out if I'm having issue with the colors or something else.2.) the 2nd issue is not with the tablet itself but after using this for a while i've realized using 8"" tablets for watching movies is not a good experience."
3461,Electronics,4,This was just the right screen size. We were price shopping and luckily found it on sale too.
3462,Health & Beauty,4,still going
3463,Health & Beauty,4,These seem to be normal AAA batteries. can't comment yet on life expectancy but for the price they could stand to be near the bottom performance and still be an okay value.
3464,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. Long lasting
3465,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries were a huge disappointment. I used two in my amazon tv remote and they lasted only 2 weeks. Usually, I only need to change batteries in that remote every 3-4 months or so. Total ripoff."
3466,Electronics,4,"My nephew loved the tablet. He's able to download his games and has not experienced any issues as of yet. Fast and efficient, but you will need an Amazon account to run the tablet properly."
3467,Health & Beauty,5,Great product. Fast shipping!
3468,Health & Beauty,5,Good product.
3469,Health & Beauty,5,Always a great product and great value. I love amazon.
3470,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries. They work. Seem to last the right amount of time.
3471,Health & Beauty,2,they do not last like other batteries. i use in candles with timers... i get maybe 2 weeks out of them... 50+ hours.... i use to get months out of my duracell....
3472,Electronics,3,It was working great then all of a sudden it wouldnt come on
3473,Health & Beauty,5,just as described
3474,Electronics,4,My daughter got this tablet for Christmas and is very happy with it. The parental controls are awesome and make me feel safe as a parent. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with set up instructions.
3475,Electronics,4,Got this for the family and we all love it. Great gift
3476,Electronics,4,Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
3477,Electronics,4,"First, the bad. I hate the advertisements and the fact that you can't access the vast library of Android apps via Google Play. Nevertheless, you can do most of the things on the Internet that you need to while still have access to Amazon Fire-friendly apps that will keep you informed and entertained. The good news is that the HD8 has an expansion slot for a microSD card and increasing storage space is where the Fire HD8 dances all over the iPad. Add in a 128GB microSD card and you'll have tons of room for audiobooks, ebooks, music files, photos, and videos. The HD8 also has Amazon Alexa in case you're looking for automated help to shop or move around from interest online or on your Kindle Fire.It's a good buy - especially if you buy one when they are on sale!"
3478,Electronics,4,"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
3479,Health & Beauty,5,High quality batteries
3480,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome Amazon product! Using them for various electronics and my son's wireless headphones! Thanks Amazon!
3481,Electronics,4,"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
3482,Electronics,4,Convenient and easy for my 10 year old to use to do homework on.
3483,Health & Beauty,5,big pack of batteries...work well :)
3484,Health & Beauty,5,same..they fulfill a need
3485,Health & Beauty,5,Came as described. I would buy again
3486,Electronics,4,Great for my kid. She takes it on all our road trip.
3487,Electronics,4,Very easy to use and love the graphics of the screen.
3488,Health & Beauty,2,These die a lot quicker than typical energizer and duracell batteries
3489,Electronics,4,Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
3490,Electronics,4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
3491,Electronics,2,"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
3492,Electronics,4,I purchased this tablet for my 83 year old mom who has never used a computer. She wants to be able to purchase items on line.
3493,Electronics,4,"I like how it plays music. It is perfect to connect to smart home products. Such as nest, Belkin , and many others. It is easy to use."
3494,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
3495,Health & Beauty,5,I usually only buy Duracell batteries that I purchase on sale through Groupon. I received a bad batch and it always takes so long to get them that I decided to give the Amazon batteries a try. I'll never buy another battery anywhere else. Thank you Amazon for providing another quality product that worked as well as the most expensive brands out there at a reduced price. Shipping was prompt and on time.
3496,Electronics,4,"Grandson has loved this since he opened it for his Birthday He was able to use it,figure it out, right away The protective case actually makes it easier for him to handle. Simple to set up for his home internet and parents were able to view and set up controls of their choice."
3497,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,This little device is great for it price. Lots of features.
3498,Electronics,4,GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
3499,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good
3500,Electronics,4,I brought it for my grandmother and she really loves it.
3501,Health & Beauty,5,"They're batteries, what can you say"
3502,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
3503,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.
3504,Electronics,2,"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
3505,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.
3506,Health & Beauty,3,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
3507,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and functional. Can't ask for much more.
3508,Electronics,4,"I bought it for my husband for a gift but I use it as much as he does. Perfect size, good sound quality overall great product."
3509,Health & Beauty,3,Goog
3510,Health & Beauty,1,"So, I saw all the glowing reviews and was startled by the low price for 48 of this alkaline batteries. Yeah, well, NOW I am startled by how long they last. Uh-oh, make that DON'T last. I don't take but 20 to 30 shots from my little Finepix camera before the lens starts closing when I try to shoot. Compare that to...well, I'm not gonna lie. I never counted, but I took TONS of shots using Duracell alkaline bats. Conservative estimate At least 300 shots for each set of two. Einstein not needed to do the math on that. I just looked and see that they are made in Indonesia, which may or may not matter, since I don't know where Duracells are made. I still have 34 of these lousy things left. Ticks me off, royally!!!(Now, let us see if this shows as a confirmed purchase."
3511,Electronics,4,Awesome tablet for kids pre loaded with a ton of things and the case is even better
3512,Health & Beauty,5,it works
3513,Electronics,4,Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
3514,Electronics,3,"I was really excited for this speaker. Got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go. Then I listened to the music. It has no bass. If you want something the has a good range of sound, this isn't it. It is focused on treble only. No low end. I ended up getting the JBL Charge 3. Love it"
3515,Electronics,4,"great price, but doesn't do a number of things that it should. and the advertisements every time I turn it on really suck"
3516,Health & Beauty,1,Worst battery I have ever came across. Don't use for children's toys leaks battery acid. Had in my daughters mobile and the batteries only lasted 4 days when any other battery lasts a month and when I replaced them this morning I found they leaked battery acid all over.
3517,Health & Beauty,5,arrived on time just as described
3518,Health & Beauty,5,Great value product!
3519,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"When used with AMAZON Prime and the ""FreeTime"" app for kids this is a great tablet. Recommend installing at least 32 gb of micro SD card storage and install apps to the card to insure that the tablet has enough free space to handle videos. Easy enough to use for our 2 year old grandson."
3520,Electronics,3,Son loves it........................................
3521,Health & Beauty,5,Great would buy again
3522,Electronics,4,My 11 year old loves it. He likes the look and it loads videos quickly.
3523,Electronics,4,It is very simple to start up and use. Great for all ages and experience on using tablets.
3524,Health & Beauty,5,Great Basic AA batteries!
3525,Health & Beauty,5,They work as expected and are inexpensive.
3526,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
3527,Electronics,4,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
3528,Electronics,4,bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
3529,Health & Beauty,4,"In all honesty, these batteries last about as long as any other brand. The only better thing about them is that they are cheaper."
3530,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD ALKALINE BATTERIES. AREN'T ALL ALKALINE THE SAME ADVERTISING STEERS SOME PEOPLE.
3531,Health & Beauty,5,"As a teacher, I need tons of batteries, but I refused to spend excessive amounts on them, so I figured this was the best option! They are long-lasting, worth the money, cute (if that even matters, lol)! You won't find a deal like this in stores!I highly recommend!"
3532,Electronics,4,amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
3533,Health & Beauty,5,Works great just what it says.
3534,Health & Beauty,5,Ok
3535,Health & Beauty,3,"so far they are work well, however have had them long enough to determine if how long they last compared to duracell batteries."
3536,Electronics,3,"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
3537,Health & Beauty,3,"Lots of batteries, but I am going through them pretty quickly. I will switch to a higher quality battery on my next order."
3538,Health & Beauty,5,Everyone needs AA batteries. These are fine and a great price!
3539,Electronics,4,"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
3540,Electronics,4,"Wanted something to use while charging my iPad, easy to use."
3541,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
3542,Electronics,4,The kids couldn't wait to turn them on and I'm very excited.
3543,Electronics,4,"This tablet does a great deal! From surfing the net, to watching movie, and using all of the music channels, this is an affordable way to stay in touch. Also, I use it for ebooks for school."
3544,Health & Beauty,1,they don't hold a charge like the top brands do.
3545,Health & Beauty,4,Longest lasting I have ever used
3546,Health & Beauty,5,great value
3547,Electronics,4,"This tablet is small, compact and easy to handle. It's easy to figure out the main functions. My one complaint is that it does not support some big apps such as Dropbox or Google Drive."
3548,Health & Beauty,5,Decent batteries...gets the job done.
3549,Health & Beauty,3,"Of the four used so far, two already lost charge, one so much as giving a negative read on a voltmeter."
3550,Health & Beauty,5,Work just as well as any other batteries and are cheaper!
3551,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries die extremely quick
3552,Electronics,3,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could."
3553,Health & Beauty,5,good deal
3554,Electronics,4,"I have the Kindle HD7 but wanted something between it and a 10"" tablet.The Bluetooth function lets you use a wireless keyboard, which makes things easier than typing on the screen."
3555,Health & Beauty,5,"Awesome delivery time, product was described perfectly, will shop again!!!!"
3556,Health & Beauty,4,"Decent batteries, I find they die a little quicker than others, but still fine for the price"
3557,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My son loves it and he's been using/playing with it every after school.
3558,Health & Beauty,5,Great product.
3559,Health & Beauty,3,Not sure about these yet. The question is whether the battery last long enough for the price that i paid for them. Will update later when i find out.
3560,Health & Beauty,4,"good price, straight forward and cheaper than your local dollar store."
3561,Health & Beauty,2,"About half of the batteries won't recharge, so I threw them away"
3562,Health & Beauty,5,Everything as it should be. Thank you.
3563,Electronics,4,"This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well."
3564,Health & Beauty,4,"Price can't be beat...batteries aren't great, but they're so cheap"
3565,Health & Beauty,4,Does the job. Seems to have good life. One complaint is that the batteries are in sealed groups of 4 which complicates opening them. A simple box of 48 loose would be much easier to deal with.
3566,Health & Beauty,5,So far these have performed as well as the more expensive Name Brand batteries
3567,Health & Beauty,1,Ordered the Triple AAA battery pack and I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what but pretty much not a single battery works. What a waste of money so they definitely deserve one star.
3568,Health & Beauty,3,I think it was recargable
3569,Electronics,4,We are having fun with this tablet. HD movies and games...easy to use and to read kindle books!
3570,Electronics,4,"I bought this Kindle because I needed something light and portable to take with me to class throughout the day on an 8-5 schedule. And so far, no complaints! Only that the camera function is pretty useless what with its low quality and lack of autofocus, or focus at all for that matter, but I knew that going in. Battery lasts all day, which is awesome since I keep all my notes on it. Touch screen might not be as sensitive as one would like, but overall? It does the job and does it well."
3571,Electronics,4,Great tablet with a lot of features. Great price too.
3572,Health & Beauty,3,"What we expected, a bargain battery, so we are happy."
3573,Health & Beauty,4,good value and time will tell if they last as long as duracell
3574,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Always content with best buy and their products. I would definitely recommend.
3575,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and made all of our Christmas toys work!
3576,Health & Beauty,5,good power
3577,Health & Beauty,5,Always buy!
3578,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries are way cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. The batteries lasted a long time and I won't run out any time soon.
3579,Health & Beauty,5,Best battery I have found to date
3580,Electronics,4,Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
3581,Health & Beauty,5,"so far, so good"
3582,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal. They are what they are but seem to hold life pretty well. Will definitely buy again when I need to restock.
3583,Electronics,3,"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
3584,Electronics,4,Needed a tablet for games and apps for the elderly. Great choice
3585,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,It is difficult to understand the instructions. I am still working on it.
3586,Health & Beauty,5,Terrific value and great product! I definitely recommend it!
3587,Electronics,4,This device meets the needs of my grandson. He can read and play games on it. It also has the parental safeguards.
3588,Electronics,4,"There are better tablets out there, but not at this price point, and if you are a prime member it's a no brainer!"
3589,Health & Beauty,4,Yep buying more. My go to batteries
3590,Electronics,3,"Not happy at first as battery was totally dead when I got it. However, after charging, it's working ok"
3591,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I purchased this tablet for my 3 year old and he loves it. He has learned a lot. Only con is that it takes a long time to charge and doesn't stay charged for long
3592,Electronics,4,"Pros: liked the warranty, liked that it came with a case making it cost less than buying one separately. Cons: One grandchild was too old for the games included on his locked portion. Was hoping I could put games on a particular grandchilds site and lock it so he couldn't download other things. Would recommend this only for very young children."
3593,Health & Beauty,4,"Good batteries for the price, they last a decent amount of time like other major brands. These came in handy near Christmas time with all the toys Santa brought. They are packaged in groups of 4 and I like how they have a container (cardboard box with cover) to keep them stored. I would definitely buy them again.they are NOT rechargeable and for some reason I thought they were when I bought them....had a brain fart or something. Good batteries overall regardless."
3594,Health & Beauty,5,very good bargain.
3595,Electronics,4,"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
3596,Health & Beauty,5,great
3597,Electronics,1,"It‚Äôs great that you can enhance capacity via a memory card, but the fact that a brand new product stops working within an hour of opening it reduces confidence significantly"
3598,Health & Beauty,4,Item is as advertised
3599,Health & Beauty,4,Good item
3600,Electronics,4,I was looking for an easy to use tablet at a low price and this was a perfect match.
3601,Electronics,2,"Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so."
3602,Electronics,4,New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
3603,Health & Beauty,5,"Living in a remote control world like I do I use a pretty fair amount of batteries, I find that these Amazon brand batteries are just as good or better than the copper top, or energizer, the price is competitive with the other brands , Kirkland, acdelco, rayovac, the preform really well in all devices, and the shelf life is great, I would recommend highly,"
3604,Health & Beauty,5,"Good price, work great"
3605,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries are batteries.
3606,Health & Beauty,4,As expected. Batteries at a good price. Batteries come in a brown box. Inside the batteries are in groups of 4.
3607,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to lady just as long as the name brand. Worth a go for flash photographers
3608,Electronics,4,"Not the fanciest tablet, but it definitely gets the job done! Bought as a gift for a friend that wanted an e-reader and he loves it!"
3609,Health & Beauty,4,i recommend this
3610,Electronics,4,The tablet works well and the silicon pumper cover is great for gripping.
3611,Electronics,4,"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
3612,Health & Beauty,4,Not sure what else to say other than these are cheap batteries. Great price.
3613,Electronics,4,This is a pretty reliable tablet especially for the price.
3614,Electronics,4,Bought for my 4 year old very easy for him to use and has good parental controls.
3615,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries and a lot cheaper than the name brands. Would definitely recommend!
3616,Health & Beauty,4,EXCELLENT BATTERIES FOR THE PRICE.
3617,Electronics,4,Simple to use and setup for a 2 years old toddler.
3618,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet for basic needs.. internet.. video streaming.. games.. books... you dont need an ipad?.. get one of these.
3619,Health & Beauty,2,"I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch"
3620,Electronics,2,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better
3621,Electronics,4,"This is a solid tablet for the money, great size, easy to use"
3622,Electronics,4,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
3623,Electronics,4,It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
3624,Electronics,4,More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
3625,Electronics,3,"In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house."
3626,Health & Beauty,5,works as well as name brand batteries.
3627,Health & Beauty,5,"Nice and fresh, dated 10 years out! I use these in everything, should last a long time."
3628,Health & Beauty,5,good stuff!!
3629,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries must be old don't work!
3630,Electronics,4,This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
3631,Electronics,4,Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
3632,Electronics,4,Got this tablet for my spouse who has never had one before and it's perfect for him!
3633,Electronics,4,It is definitely not the fastest or the best looking tablet but for $30 is more than enough to browse the web and do some shopping.
3634,Health & Beauty,5,Great nice to have on hand
3635,Health & Beauty,1,"Approximately half of the batteries I've tried so far are dead. Low expectations for the remainder of the lot, and never buy these again."
3636,Health & Beauty,5,Worked great
3637,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries, will be getting a lot more of these."
3638,Electronics,3,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
3639,Health & Beauty,5,"The best buy anywhere, this is the only place we get our batteries."
3640,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Good tablet. Easy to use for 5 yr. Not as many free stuff as expected. Have to pay for most games, movies and books."
3641,Electronics,4,Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.
3642,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries are batteries are batteries. These are good. Last as long as they should. Came quickly.
3643,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Intuitive to figure out most functions and operations.
3644,Health & Beauty,4,I have been using these batteries for about a month now and the half I have used have performed very well. The Batteries I inserted into 3 items when they arrived are still working.So far I have found no bad batteries included in my order.Would recommend based on performance of the batteries I have used so far.
3645,Health & Beauty,1,I waited to write this review until I had tried nearly all of the batteries that I ordered. Most of them did not have any power in them. The few that did work lasted maybe an hour. I pitched the remaining 6 because I cannot depend on them at this point. Maybe I just got a bad batch but these are the worst collection batteries I have ever used. I would not recommend these to anyone else based on my experience.
3646,Health & Beauty,4,"So far so good, will update rating when finished"
3647,Electronics,4,"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop. This does not compete with them. Absolutely outstanding outside in Dallas. This does not overheat, with absolutely zero glare. Yes I can read in the pool on a sunny day. I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail. I wish the unit was truly water resistant and it's built in browser is almost worthless. This is an eReader and not a tablet."
3648,Health & Beauty,5,"Exactly what I needed, lots of AA batteries for a cheap price. They last just as long as any other battery so this was totally worth it. Will only buy my batteries from here now on."
3649,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries on the cheap! Every bit as good as a Duracell, Energizer, etc."
3650,Health & Beauty,5,Quality product and well worth the money.
3651,Electronics,4,"I thought about purchasing a Samsung tablet also, however I do like to read as well. I saw several reviews that have a negative view because of the Amazon software and that it is not stock Android.However, I have installed the Play Store (you can find instructions online) and I am very happy with this tablet. I would definitely recommend it. Also I have had 10"" tablets before, and this one is just the right size."
3652,Electronics,4,More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
3653,Electronics,4,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
3654,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries!
3655,Health & Beauty,1,None of these batteries had a full charge. My charge detector never reached the green zone. They were one half used up. This was true for the other two sizes D and AAA.
3656,Health & Beauty,4,The price was good and so far the batteries I have used work fine. I do not have a battery tester nor the time (if I had a battery tester) to test each and every battery as others have done. I am just going to believe that they will all work just fine.
3657,Health & Beauty,1,love them work great but while charging they leaked all over the charger and had to just throw 8 of them away
3658,Health & Beauty,4,Great I brought to many
3659,Health & Beauty,1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
3660,Health & Beauty,5,Great for the price. Good buy!
3661,Health & Beauty,1,they are not good as described. the power is easy to be used out.
3662,Health & Beauty,4,All are working as they should. Very good purchase.
3663,Health & Beauty,5,love it!
3664,Electronics,1,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
3665,Electronics,4,"Good for kids, it‚Äôs no iPad but can‚Äôt beat it for the price"
3666,Health & Beauty,5,your basic batteries but cheaper. Did not notice shorter life span. Great for college
3667,Health & Beauty,5,"Everyone needs extra batteries around the house. These Amazon Basics AA are in every control that I have in my home. As far as I can tell they last as long as the expensive main brands. Get a box of batteries, throw them in 'that' drawer, and never run out of batteries again."
3668,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,It would not turn on or charge. We have to return it to Kindle.
3669,Electronics,3,"The camera is not very sharp , and you can not download another one ."
3670,Electronics,4,"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
3671,Electronics,4,I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
3672,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
3673,Health & Beauty,5,good
3674,Health & Beauty,5,Can't argue with this price especially if you have prime.
3675,Electronics,4,"I like the size and quick connection, but sometimes App store can't find the items I look for."
3676,Health & Beauty,5,Price is right and we'll have to see how long they last..
3677,Health & Beauty,5,Great!
3678,Health & Beauty,5,Good so far.
3679,Electronics,4,I bought this for my great-grandson who is 3 years old. I had purchased one for his 5 year-old sister for Christmas and it became the object of dispute between them because he wants to use it too. They both enjoy it. It is entertaining and educational. Now they each will have their own and the dispute can end.
3680,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries die quickly!
3681,Health & Beauty,2,These die really quick.
3682,Health & Beauty,5,"Really good quality batteries. Heavy, not light like the cheap brands."
3683,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries at a fair price.
3684,Electronics,4,Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
3685,Electronics,4,"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
3686,Electronics,4,limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works
3687,Health & Beauty,2,Drain quick
3688,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries work perfectly. Only problem is the packaging is a little large. You will need to put them in a smaller container unless u have a ton of cupboard space.
3689,Electronics,4,Got these on black Friday for early Christmas gifts. Very good buy on a pretty good tablet.
3690,Health & Beauty,4,"They don't hold a lot of charge, but it's a lot of AAs"
3691,Health & Beauty,4,Decent batteries at a pretty good price. I will buy again.
3692,Electronics,4,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
3693,Health & Beauty,4,I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
3694,Electronics,4,My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
3695,Electronics,4,"The fire fits perfect into my hand. It is easy to navigate thru all the uses. I got hooked on the solitary game, can't put it down! Also,I get books from the library to read on Axis 360. I can get my emails and breaking news."
3696,Electronics,4,It is well designed with a safe cover for kids. It also come with 2 year warranty. My son loves it already.
3697,Health & Beauty,5,Works good so far. Time will tell the true story. Great price!
3698,Health & Beauty,3,Sorry to say I've been disappointed with these. They didn't last as long in my remotes and RC transmitters as even other store brand alkaline batteries.
3699,"Electronics,Media",4,"This product may be extremely overpriced, but it also lives up to everything it's promised. It's a lightweight, long-lasting ereader that is much easier on the eyes than an iPad. It is much lighter and more ergonomical than a paperback, and I find myself renting kindle copies of books I already own just to take advantage of the device's convenience."
3700,Health & Beauty,5,Good
3701,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
3702,Health & Beauty,5,great an the price is wonderful
3703,Health & Beauty,5,they work grate will def buy more
3704,Health & Beauty,5,Nicely packaged. Work well. Great alternative to the more expensive brands.
3705,Electronics,4,The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
3706,Electronics,4,Purchased for my grand child. They love it. They play and add gamehis.
3707,Electronics,2,"Love the Dot, Hate the Tap Portable! This device will not hold a charge for even one day. The dots are amazing though."
3708,Health & Beauty,2,"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term."
3709,Electronics,3,"This makes for a decent tablet for a kid with the kids edition, but I'm not sure I'd want it as an adult. There are much better tablets on the market. But since it's cheap, that's to be expected."
3710,Electronics,4,Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
3711,Electronics,4,This is a great Tablet at a really great price. The best part is if you happen to break it just buy a new one
3712,Electronics,4,For the most part I like the tablet. Got it for my mother. The con is you have to use Amazon for apps.
3713,Electronics,4,"Great little product for the price. Not the best camera, but it doesn't claim to be. ."
3714,Health & Beauty,5,Have been outlasting previously purchased duracell procells in my bass guitar wireless transmtter
3715,Health & Beauty,5,Good product as decribed.
3716,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent.
3717,Health & Beauty,5,"Blown away by the affordability of these batteries. Even if they're slightly subpar in length of useful life, it's STILL a killer deal."
3718,Health & Beauty,5,Good battery life and reasonable price!
3719,Health & Beauty,5,Superior to Dura C batteries. I compared new batteries of each brand in the same flashlight. Amazon batteries were brighter.
3720,Electronics,4,Once the games are downloaded it was great for long road trips.
3721,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The color is what got me and the features was on point. The screen shows a lot of different displays. To share for now until the next one.
3722,Health & Beauty,1,"You get what you pay for here. These are cheap batteries and don't last very long, I'd spend the extra and get rechargeables."
3723,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Good, but unhappy that screen size is small, less than I expected"
3724,Electronics,3,We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
3725,Electronics,4,"I got the wrong one, plain and simple. It does what it says, and I like the connection to the internet to play music, but I should have gotten the Echo, I get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button."
3726,Health & Beauty,5,Seems to have lifespan of other name brand batteries. Happy with them
3727,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and I see no difference between these and the leading brands.
3728,Electronics,4,"cool tablet that you can use daily, just freezes a bit, but the reset button works well."
3729,Health & Beauty,2,Go with a brand name.
3730,Electronics,4,This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
3731,Electronics,1,"The touch and loading the content is very bad, it doesn't respond quickly and it very slow"
3732,Health & Beauty,5,work fine
3733,Health & Beauty,5,Great price!
3734,Electronics,4,Enjoy using this product. My granddaughter downloads multiplied games to play and can play them while traveling. Good size and can easily fit into small bag.
3735,Health & Beauty,3,"On average, these batteries do not last as long as the Energizer. They cost less to buy, but overall, there isn't much saving."
3736,Electronics,4,Purchased this tablet for a gift..They love it. Easy to use.
3737,Health & Beauty,4,Great price and they work very well will continue to buy these amazon batteries compared to the other brands in the future. Loved to save money and the work the same as the other competitors.
3738,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,Got this for my 9 year old and several games that he wants to play are not accessible on this tablet. Seems like this is geared more towards younger kids. Case is good though and keeps tablet safe. Would be tough to break!!
3739,Electronics,3,Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
3740,Health & Beauty,4,They are batteries.
3741,Electronics,1,"Very disappointed that my Kindle Voyage, purchased in April, failed after just two uses. Went to charge it tonight to take on a business trip and it won't charge, won't reset, etc. Since my Best Buy receipt says I only have 15 days to return it, tried calling Amazon support. Their only solution after over 30 minutes on the phone is to process a replacement which may be a new or may be a refurbished device-- unacceptable to replace a less than 2-month old device with a refurbished one... but, given the poor experience I've had with the Voyage, I'm not even comfortable with a 'new' replacement at this point. Amazon says they can't do anything about a refund because I purchased from Best Buy-- 15 days seems a little extreme in a situation like this with a defective product!Stuck with a $200 paperweight :-("
3742,Health & Beauty,5,good price
3743,Electronics,4,"i just adore my fire 8...the features, size of screen, easy log in and graphics"
3744,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,I bought this tablet for my son and I don't like it. The touch screen is very poor quality. It's hard to move things around on it when he is playing a game. He prefers my iPad than to use his own. I know the iPad quality is probably the best quality but it's way under that! Very frustrating. Will be returning it.
3745,Health & Beauty,4,good quality
3746,Electronics,4,I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
3747,Health & Beauty,4,Works great for everyday AA battery needs
3748,Health & Beauty,5,very impressed with Amazon batteries. making the switch to them for now.
3749,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, delivered to your doorstep for free with Prime - whatever did we do before Amazon"
3750,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Grandchild loves the tablet. Easy to set up and child and adult user griendly
3751,Health & Beauty,5,"Cheap and so far good quality, much better than the Sam's Club packs"
3752,Health & Beauty,5,"always changing batteries in the kids toys, these are cheap and last well for the"
3753,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, great product!"
3754,Health & Beauty,5,Great
3755,Electronics,4,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
3756,Electronics,4,I am happy to get this product and i would also recommend this to my friends
3757,Health & Beauty,5,ok
3758,Health & Beauty,4,Quite nice... last a reasonable time.
3759,Electronics,4,This is great to occupy your child on the long road trip or just when you need a break from entertaining the little one. Works great and they can damage or mess up their own toys without using your cell phone or other adult device.
3760,Electronics,4,Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
3761,Electronics,4,"Purchased this for my grandson. It works great. However, if I were to do it over again I would spend the extra $$$ to get the one without the ads. They drive you crazy. The ads make the cheaper unit really frustrating."
3762,Electronics,4,This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
3763,Health & Beauty,4,I can never have too many batteries - so many little things from remotes to flashlights. It is great to know I don't have to rake through drawers looking for batteries.
3764,Health & Beauty,4,Good less expensive bulk pack. Great alternative for toys and games that seem to eat batteries and won't break the bank. Seem to work well enough and rival the name brands. Will buy again.
3765,Health & Beauty,5,ya....fine .....I mean its a battery .....How long they gonna last
3766,Electronics,4,Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all
3767,Electronics,4,"I have two young sons. After their previous tablet broke, I had to decide on which new one to replace it with. There is a growing number of tablets and systems to choose from for kids now. Having had previous experience with an Amazon Fire Kids Edition in the past, it was hard to ignore the many great features that it provides. Although it lacks Google play, this is ideal for kids 3-8."
3768,Health & Beauty,5,Great long lasting. Would buy again.
3769,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone."
3770,Electronics,4,The tablet has great picture and apps but the sound is really bad and this is 3rd tablet
3771,Electronics,4,Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
3772,Electronics,4,The Kindle is very great reader and recommendable for people.
3773,Health & Beauty,4,"LEDs run thru these so fast man. But, I'm lazy and amazon delivers so I keep buying them. Don't have a time sheet. But I have one of those harbour freight free with purchase lights and it seemed to last 5 hours before I noticed it was dim. So that's good I guess as its still very bright, just not new, never been used bright.Usually I replace 1 out the 3 batteries every 3 weeks. But I work on a bike and car, and have never had any LED go out or get unusable dim during a job with a fresh change."
3774,Health & Beauty,2,Very short lifespan.
3775,Health & Beauty,1,never again. don't last. especially short life in cold weather.
3776,Health & Beauty,3,Doesn't last long at all
3777,Health & Beauty,5,worked
3778,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
3779,"Office Supplies,Electronics",1,"Over the past few years, I have purchased Kindle Fires for various family members. The workmanship for those Kindles in abysmal. Two weeks ago, my Kindle Fire HDX shorted itself out. I replaced it with Amazon Fire 10.1. This device does NOT hold a charge for more than three and a half hours. You read that correctly!. I have been using it on a daily basis, each time it needs to be charged, it does a repeat performance. There is absolutely NO way that I will ever purchase any device manufactured by Amazon, ever again. I tell it like it is, if you want terrible device performance, opt for the Amazon product. If you need a reliable device, look at other manufacturers for the options you need."
3780,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,We bought this as a Christmas gift for our 6 year old. He loves it. It's durable and reliable.
3781,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My grandson is very happy with his Kindle. The case protects it very well.
3782,Health & Beauty,5,Easy to order easy to keep a reoccurring order if you tend use batteries often. I don't notice a difference between this brand or a more popular branch in terms of durability. We keep them on hand at our house because you never know when you'll need one or four of them. I'll be ordering them again soon.
3783,Electronics,4,Still in the learning process--looking forward to more benefits!
3784,Health & Beauty,1,The battery life is much poorer compared to name brands like energizer and Duracell.
3785,Health & Beauty,5,Happy so far. Seem to be lasting well.
3786,Electronics,3,This is a good tablet for basic use. I ened up returning it and going with an iPad which met my needs more. This tablet would be good for someone with limited computer knowledge/use.
3787,Electronics,4,Great quality for kids very fun very durable great warranty gave 4 stars because it could be easier to download shows and such but once I learned (not very tech savvy) it's easy.
3788,Health & Beauty,4,"Just started using this pack, and so far they've lasted as long as any leading brand battery. The price is also fair, for the amount that they offer you."
3789,Health & Beauty,1,Terrible! Didn't last 2 weeks!
3790,Health & Beauty,5,Good long lasting batteries. I used AA for gaming so I go through alot
3791,Electronics,4,"I am happy with the Fire given the price I paid. As reviews stated, the camera is not very good. Would like it better if it could mirror to a smart TV. Otherwise, for the value it is a good product."
3792,Health & Beauty,4,Same for these AA batteries as for the AAA batteries.
3793,Electronics,4,Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with
3794,Health & Beauty,5,Good work
3795,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My son absolutely loves it but not enough storage.
3796,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries! They work to charge your electronics!
3797,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet for reading and watching videos, nice large, clear screen while still being able to fit in a large purse."
3798,Health & Beauty,5,These work just as good as any other batteries and cost less.
3799,Health & Beauty,4,Great inexpensive
3800,Health & Beauty,4,Always a good deal
3801,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, good quantity and they do the job. I would definitely order this product again."
3802,Health & Beauty,5,"Great deal, they last pretty long"
3803,Electronics,4,Nice deals on the product with saving and good customet experience.
3804,Electronics,3,This was a birthday gift! It has nice visual features! It was easy to get started on it! So far so good!!
3805,Health & Beauty,3,It's a battery...
3806,Electronics,3,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
3807,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
3808,Electronics,4,"Here are my pros and cons thus far.PRO:Perfect size for Ebooks, and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my 5"" phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice heft but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketChild Accounts- Amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil Johnny can play Clash of Clans and how much he can hit the ol' Visa card for.Battery life thus far; wife was on it for about 5 hours last night and battery was at about 46%Kindle Integration -this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books synced to the tablet is awesome and my Kindle books look great"
3809,Electronics,4,"My 14yo daughter loves to read and watch certain shows on Netflix as well as Amazon prime. She is less interested in the apps which is a good thing since you do not have access to google play and all of those apps unless you 'side load' the Google play app which, for the casual person, is more technical that you would like."
3810,Health & Beauty,5,Great value and work just as well as name brand batteries purchased in the store. Will continue purchasing.
3811,Electronics,4,Recently upgraded from the 7inch kindle and i must say huge improvements. all i can say is that if they can speed up the processor by next year with more ram they might compete with the ipad!
3812,"Toys & Games,Electronics",2,Hard time getting the free apps to load and the voice app to turn off when my seven year old accedently turned it on.
3813,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries are good, duracell might last just a tad bit longer but the price difference is not worth the extra . Kind of hard to review a batteries, but the packaging was easy to open and the batteries were neatly packaged."
3814,Electronics,4,Good tablet for kids. Easy to use and kid friendly
3815,Electronics,4,My newphew loves it! He's 4 years old and can easily use the tablet.
3816,Health & Beauty,2,"Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well"
3817,Health & Beauty,5,good.
3818,Health & Beauty,3,They dont last long but they are cheap
3819,Health & Beauty,2,The price is good but they 'battery life' is much lower than other alkaline batteries we use. I get approx half the life from these batteries - compared to Walmart RayoVacs
3820,Health & Beauty,5,"cheap, work well. they are batteries."
3821,Health & Beauty,4,"Great price! What can I say, besides that they work and so far haven't showed less quality from a brand name battery."
3822,Health & Beauty,5,Nice price
3823,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries what more could you ask for.
3824,Health & Beauty,5,AN AMAZING PRICE FOR 48 VERY HIGH QUALITY BATTERIES. loved this pack. the batteries come in 4's in plastic inside a big box
3825,Health & Beauty,5,Very Good
3826,Health & Beauty,5,excellent
3827,Electronics,3,"The Kindle is great for just reading books, and the battery power is pretty good.The experimental browser is not very user friendly."
3828,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"had a problem with my purchase, but Best Buy made it good, they are very good!"
3829,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
3830,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and convenient! Work great and last just as long as others!
3831,Health & Beauty,4,"I think my favorite thing is that they come in the convenient box. Keeps my junk drawer a lot neater without having batteries rolling around or stuck in baggies. Otherwise, they're just batteries. I haven't noticed any difference from the duracells and energizers I used to use."
3832,Health & Beauty,5,great
3833,Health & Beauty,4,Work like my other batteries
3834,Electronics,4,I can‚Äôt find earphones for my Amazon fire 7th.xxxx
3835,Health & Beauty,5,"The work, price is right and holds a charge"
3836,Electronics,4,"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
3837,Health & Beauty,3,not as good as the higher quality batteries would not buy again
3838,Health & Beauty,2,Adequate
3839,Electronics,4,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
3840,Electronics,4,i can allow kids what i want them to read or play with
3841,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries. Long lasting in small MP3 player.
3842,Health & Beauty,1,Great price but these do not last very long.
3843,Electronics,3,No instructions. Either paper or electronic. How do I transfer apps & data from old kindle to new one 9
3844,Electronics,4,"I really haven't had a chance to use this much yet, but it seems like a coll little gadget."
3845,Electronics,4,I love this Kindle and bought it for the upgrades to replace my original kindle fire. I would give it an excellent rating if the camera were better but the pictures come out grainy and not very clear. Great for watching shows and videos and these are very clear.. Love playing games on it and of course reading the latest books.
3846,Health & Beauty,1,I can only think of one way to describe this item...JUNK!!!
3847,Electronics,1,"I bought this product 4 months back. It is very slow, i can't open any app in 15 seconds. OS is different than others so we can't get normal apps easily. Only one thing i can say is slow slow slow performance. I don't know how to replace it. Need some help from best buy people.I don't know whether i got defective piece or this is the actual performance"
3848,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries at a great price.. I trust amazon so why not their batteries
3849,Electronics,4,I haven't figured it out yet. So far it seems ok but I haven't used all of its potential yet.
3850,Electronics,4,"The fire hd 8 is a nice improvement over the 7"" model. First, the extra ram makes browsing noticeably smoother and the screen is crystal clear. It is not on the same level as apple ipad or samsung galaxy, but still a huge improvement over previous kindle tablets."
3851,Health & Beauty,5,excellent price
3852,Electronics,4,Great tablet and kid case. I just wish it came with kids apps.
3853,Health & Beauty,3,Good deal for outdoor solar lights.
3854,Health & Beauty,4,Worked very well but I did not compare power density to other alkaline bateries
3855,Health & Beauty,4,Good but don't last as long as others.
3856,Health & Beauty,5,"Real good, Worked as soon as I put them in. But made in China. not the USA. Trump 2016."
3857,Electronics,4,Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
3858,Health & Beauty,5,Fast delivery and good price.
3859,Health & Beauty,3,"Not sure how long these last yet, but seem fine so far. I like the box they come in that is strong, but then they put hard plastic wrap on 4 packs of the battery that are a pain to remove. Get out your knife, don't cut yourself."
3860,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,volume is a problem we have to take off the protective case for it to sound clear.
3861,Health & Beauty,2,Dies fast
3862,Electronics,4,I got this for my mom for christmas. It is a cheap alternative to using a small phone screen
3863,Electronics,4,"I personally like that it is relatively small and light in weight.So, easy to handle for my toddler.With the increased number of games and apps, downloaded on the Tablett, it slows down in speed. That, for sure, I dislike. But over al it is good to have when on the go, on car rides or long periods of waiting."
3864,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product at a great price! I have been using these alongside the more name-brand batteries, and so far they are still neck and neck! I'm always looking for a quality product at a great price, and I really feel like these have the longevity to do that. I'm very pleased, and we will be buying Amazon batteries as our household battery moving forward."
3865,Health & Beauty,5,One of my all-time favorite coffee flavors. Extremely smooth with no tangy aftertaste.
3866,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries.
3867,Electronics,4,"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
3868,Health & Beauty,4,good value here
3869,Health & Beauty,1,2 out of the 8 batteries popped while on the charger. I got battery acid all over my hands trying to get them out and cleaned up.
3870,Health & Beauty,4,They work but dont last as long as better quality batteries
3871,Electronics,3,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
3872,Health & Beauty,1,"These are the worst batteries I have ever come across. I just discovered today that mostof the batteries I was sent were dead. I put 8 batteries into a device 3 weeks ago and the batteries were already dead (energizers lasted a year and a half in the same device) I put 4 others into another device and they lasted only 1 month (energizers lasted 2 years in this device). Both devices were operated under the same conditions. I tried putting new Amazon batteries into the devices, and the devices didn't work I tried putting another set in, same problem. I then placed Energizer batteries into the devices, and they work. I essentially bought 12 working batteries that lasted less than a month in devices that used them in such a manner they would last 12x as long. Never purchasing Amazon batteries again. I would return them for being dead, but I am outside the 30 day return window."
3873,Electronics,4,For the money you can't beat what you get. iPads still rule and are far better when you aren't connected to wifi but given the cost difference I think this is the best andriod to compete with it.
3874,Health & Beauty,5,Bought these for the holidays and I have to say I am impressed. I thought for the price I couldn't go wrong but these things hold their charge compared to any name brand. Kids have been running them in their toys non stop and they keep on going. I will definitely not hesitate to buy amazon batteries ever again.
3875,Electronics,4,Purchased as an X-mas gift for my 5 y/o son and he definitely loves this tablet. Great built-in parental controls that enable us to control daily usage time and content.
3876,Health & Beauty,5,good deal
3877,Electronics,4,This Kindle is really light weight and has an excellent screen that dims or brightens automatically. Very comfortable to hold and read. I like that it has page advance buttons on both sides including the touch screen finger swipe to advance.
3878,Electronics,4,"great kid friendly product, hours of enjoyment for all."
3879,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"When you first turn on the kindle, the home screen does not make it easy to determine exactly how to open up and read a downloaded book."
3880,Health & Beauty,5,"what can i say, they do the job!"
3881,Health & Beauty,5,"Best price, hols up well and right diameter for my remotes"
3882,Health & Beauty,5,EXCELLENT
3883,Health & Beauty,5,"Great value, they provide the same amount of output as store-sourced batteries, but for less."
3884,Electronics,3,Good for alittle ones for games and movies picture not so clear but not expensive
3885,Health & Beauty,5,I find amazon basics batteries to be equal if not superior to name brand ones. Can't believe I didn't start buying them sooner! The packages are large and the price is great too.
3886,Health & Beauty,3,Decent batteries but do not seem to last that long in electronics
3887,Electronics,4,"I am happy with this product, it works well and it is affordable. The only complaint is the charge input seems a bit weak"
3888,Health & Beauty,1,all dead
3889,Health & Beauty,4,"I'll keep this relatively brief. I use rechargeable, mainly Eneloop batteries for almost everything. Every once in awhile though I have something that doesn't need the more expensive batteries or are exposed to rougher conditions like remotes or outside hose timers where I just want something disposable. These work well for that. I would buy them again"
3890,Electronics,4,Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
3891,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,"Its a decent reader for beginners. There is no backlight, so not good for reading in dark. also slips from hands, so purchase a cover if you buy it."
3892,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD PRODUCT -----GOOD PRICE
3893,Health & Beauty,5,"Finally decent batteries at an even more decent price. Will definitely be coming back when I run out. Only thing I'd change is the packaging, but I'd rather the price stay where it is as the packaging isn't that big of a deal"
3894,Health & Beauty,5,awesome value.
3895,Electronics,4,I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
3896,Electronics,4,"I decided to buy a kindle fire because of the price. It's way cheaper than most models and more reliable. I honestly didn't think I would be able to do much.with it, but can do a lot. I have Netflix on it and have binge watched a lot because of it. I am quite happy with my purchase."
3897,Electronics,3,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
3898,Electronics,4,"This kindle has good quality for the price I bought it for. It can basically do anything an iPad does, but it is a lot cheaper. I got the kindle when it was on sale . If you are using this kindle, just to browse and watch movies then it's more than enough GBSs."
3899,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,my son loves his new tablet. now he can play his games without making a mess of my phone.
3900,Health & Beauty,3,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.
3901,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries came charged, I guess that's a good thing"
3902,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome for cold/iced drinks! Keeps ice cubes from melting fast. Love this product! I wish they have a set for each design though.
3903,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Nice and durable good for the kiddos but they like it so much you do have to limit their time on it
3904,Health & Beauty,5,Great
3905,Health & Beauty,5,Great performance on the AA batteries with a great price
3906,Electronics,4,My daugther is loving this so farOne issue charging port is weak and having a hard time charging
3907,Health & Beauty,4,never can have too many.
3908,Health & Beauty,5,good product and good price
3909,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
3910,Electronics,4,"It's a good device to surf on the internet but you can't install some Android apps like Chrome, and the camera is horrible. I would recommend it for readers because you can use Hoopla, and that's amazing."
3911,Electronics,3,Would buy the cheaper one than I bought.The echo is a better product
3912,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy
3913,Health & Beauty,4,good quality
3914,Health & Beauty,5,It is so good!
3915,Electronics,4,Great for beginner and intermediate. Highly satisfied!!!
3916,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries
3917,Electronics,4,"Easy setup, love that its wireless and its fun talking to Alexa as she gives excellent information."
3918,Health & Beauty,2,They dont really last long
3919,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,So far so go it's been hard to find a good tablet for a 6yr old I believe we have found it.
3920,Electronics,4,"I love everything about it, except the glare. Great product though, easy to use, great movie quality as well. I just wish I could read it on the beach."
3921,Health & Beauty,5,"good product, good price"
3922,Health & Beauty,4,I like the battery and the saving. It seems it doesn't last longer compared to other popular brand. I don't mind changing battery after paying 4 time less than a popular brand
3923,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought it for my grandson for Christmas and so far it has been good. It is him that is the problem. He isn't able to understand some of the stuff but will in time.
3924,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"These are great tablets for the kids and the price is wonderful with the warranty and the soft, yet bulky (a good thing in this instance) case. The only thing I wish, was that it could access the Google Play Store so my kids could watch the movies we have in our Google Play Movies account."
3925,Electronics,1,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
3926,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Nice phone for the price. Would recommend if on a budget.
3927,Electronics,4,It is good. Some apps are not available. Easy to use.
3928,Electronics,4,"Everything you want in a tablet. Size is good, price is great."
3929,Health & Beauty,4,last a long time
3930,Health & Beauty,4,sdfgsdfgsdfgsdfgsdfg
3931,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent, long lasting batteries."
3932,Health & Beauty,3,There ok.
3933,Health & Beauty,5,Good price. Good product
3934,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent buy
3935,Health & Beauty,3,My remote wouldn't work so I took out my batteries and noticed the end of one of these batteries leaked all along one side of my remote.
3936,Electronics,4,"Good value, enjoy using it! I recommend this highly!"
3937,Electronics,4,I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
3938,Health & Beauty,5,"batteries.. everybody need them.. these are everybit as good as duracell for half the price, better than energizer .... very satisfied I use them for professional audio and photography..."
3939,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Great packaging and working like premium batteries.
3940,Health & Beauty,5,"Item was just as expected, and it arrived quickly!"
3941,Electronics,3,I have owned the product for about a month and it is as advertised. The case only opens about a third of the way. I have always had computer bags that opened fully. It it inconvenient to have to wrestle with the laptop trying to fit it through the small opening. I recommend spending few extra shekels and buy a case that fully opens.
3942,Health & Beauty,3,Do not last as long as Copper Top!
3943,Health & Beauty,4,It's just a smaller battery. Seems to work
3944,Health & Beauty,5,"Nice batteries, good price."
3945,Electronics,4,This was the first time I had a tablet. It is so much fun to play games on!
3946,Health & Beauty,5,They work great.
3947,Health & Beauty,3,"These batteries work. They don't last as long as I'd like but they do work fine. They came in frustration free packaging that I ended up needing scissors to open because they batteries come shrink wrapped in a little box and getting the plastic off of the batteries was NOT frustration free. So, three stars because they work but aren't great. I will probably not re-order these."
3948,Electronics,2,Good for reading but video quality is not so good.
3949,Health & Beauty,5,Great product. Great price. Packaged well.
3950,Electronics,1,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
3951,Electronics,4,"If you are in the Amazon ecosystem, the Fire HD8 is a great choice for an inexpensive tablet. Very responsive, good screen, and so far the battery life has been great. The only drawback of the Fire is the apps are only available from the Amazon App Store, not the Google Play Store. For example, there is no Gmail application to install. But that's not what I use this for... Kindle reading, Netflix viewing, occasional Facebooking and light web browsing are well suited to this device. Can't beat it for $89."
3952,Health & Beauty,5,"Fantastic bargain and holding up well months later. I go through a lot of batteries, like almost everyone nowadays. So I searched for a better deal. I think I found it here. A big savings over grocery store batteries."
3953,Electronics,4,Bought this as a replacement for my child's iPad. Took her a little while to learn the new OS but once she got the hang of it it was pretty easy. Lots of content and excellent at the price point.
3954,Electronics,4,This was easy to set up. If you are used to apple products this is a difficult transition.
3955,Electronics,4,"Really only wanted a kindle for downloading and reading books whilst traveling overseas.Seems to be OK so far, battery life seems good, relatively simple to operate, nice clear screen. My wife bought a Nook at the same time and I have to say downloading books for that seems far easier and less complicated than the Kindle Fire"
3956,Electronics,4,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
3957,Electronics,4,My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
3958,Health & Beauty,4,they seem to work well so far i have't had them long
3959,Health & Beauty,5,Quick way to stock batteries
3960,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries! I've bought 3 boxes and they are wonderful batteries!
3961,Health & Beauty,5,"Good AmazonBasics product, cheap and easy to use."
3962,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect thanks
3963,Health & Beauty,2,"I love Amazon, but these aren't at the same level as the big brands. I use them in some monitoring devices in my home. Typically I would need to change these every 3 months, but these are lasting about 6-7 weeks at best. They're ok, but just don't have the life expectancy I need."
3964,Health & Beauty,5,"Work great, nice price, great service."
3965,Health & Beauty,3,These batteries are just adequate not super strong as advertised.
3966,Electronics,4,We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
3967,Electronics,4,Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
3968,Electronics,4,Was good price.Wish it had Google Play download on to it.
3969,Electronics,3,Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
3970,Health & Beauty,5,AAA batteries. They last adequately and are at a very competitive price point. For that reason I don't think I will be buying batteries from any competitor if they're more expensive than these. Bravo Amazon.
3971,Health & Beauty,1,never again. don't last. especially short life in cold weather.
3972,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy
3973,Electronics,4,My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
3974,Health & Beauty,5,Great price point.
3975,Health & Beauty,4,real good
3976,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries do not last nearly as long as the bunny or copper brands. I will use them up and never waste my time or money on these again. I have been using them in an LED flashlight.
3977,Health & Beauty,4,it's a good deal for the price but I don't seem to get much longevity out of them. I'm not done with them and will actually match them up against other batteries and will update.
3978,Health & Beauty,5,Great performance for a great price.
3979,Health & Beauty,4,Great price. They're batteries.
3980,Electronics,4,"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
3981,Health & Beauty,4,"Good so far. I've not done extensive testing, but these seem adequate and the price is right. Definitely better than some other store brand batteries (Bass Pro Shops I'm looking at you) I've tried. They seem on par with major brand batteries to me, but that's a completely subjective evaluation."
3982,Health & Beauty,4,OK for the price.
3983,Health & Beauty,3,"A great price, to be sure...but EVERY flameless candle I have put these into has been very dim. When I replaced with Duracell (and local grocery store brand as well) the candles are noticeably brighter. Don't think I'll be buying AmazonBasics batteries again soon -- which is a bummer. I have always been impressed with Amazon-brand products but these batteries are all that."
3984,Health & Beauty,1,After one use in a regular used battery powered item it's dead. With other brand I can use the item several times before I have to replace the battery.
3985,Health & Beauty,5,What a deal on great Batteries!! Thanks Amazon!
3986,Health & Beauty,5,Very economical. Performs as well as any of the name brands
3987,Electronics,4,Received order quickly and compete. I recommend purchasing grin best buy.
3988,Electronics,3,"I bought this for my 8year old son, he loves it just has very limited games on it"
3989,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries for the x box. Now if it wasn't played 24. 7. I could save more money
3990,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good tablet durable lots of apps just right for 3 year old
3991,Electronics,4,Wanted a tablet but did not want to pay for an iPad. The fire is a great tablet with a crystal clear hd videos. The perfect inexpensive alternative to the iPad
3992,Health & Beauty,4,As expected
3993,Health & Beauty,4,great price
3994,Health & Beauty,5,"Perfect to hand out for halloween, the kids really appreciate them."
3995,Health & Beauty,4,We aren't running out of batteries now for game controllers. They seem to work just as well as any name brand.
3996,Health & Beauty,5,Best value for batteries !!
3997,Health & Beauty,5,amazing price
3998,Health & Beauty,4,"WORKS FANTASTIC, EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS, I WILL BUY IT AGAIN. GREAT PRICE, I CHECKED AND COULDN'T FIND IT CHEAPER ESPECIALLY WITH PRIME SHIPPING."
3999,Electronics,4,Tablet is easy for children to use and the battery lasts!
4000,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and works well.
4001,Health & Beauty,5,"Good buy on batteries,long life."
4002,Health & Beauty,5,So far they've worked great. I think its a good price for the number of batteries you get.
4003,Health & Beauty,5,Great product at a great price
4004,Health & Beauty,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY. Buy the name brand. I have a bathroom light that uses 3 AAA batteries. I typically get 6 months out of it with regular batteries I get roughly a week out of it with these. Sure, they are cheaper but you will buy them 4x as often. Worst Amazon purchase thus far."
4005,Electronics,1,I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
4006,Health & Beauty,3,"These batteries are ok, i've already had to replace them in my wireless keyboard, which had previously lasted 6 months on el cheapos from harbor freight."
4007,Health & Beauty,5,Seen just as good as the leading brand at an excellent price. Packaging typical best ever.
4008,Electronics,4,my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
4009,Health & Beauty,5,"Very good, on time, good package, fresh, will repeat in the future."
4010,Electronics,4,"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
4011,Health & Beauty,5,"Great batteries- good until 2025, nice."
4012,Health & Beauty,4,"KInda look like .357 rounds, eh Seriously, great value and surprisingly good lifespan."
4013,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries do not hold charge well. By the time I need to use it few weeks none of them work
4014,Electronics,3,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
4015,Health & Beauty,2,"These are OK but they don't hold up or last very long. We bought these during Christmas hoping they would be great esp since alkaline but they barely hold up to the wear and tear of everyday use in a TV remote, let alone a kids toy."
4016,Electronics,4,With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
4017,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to be working great!
4018,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
4019,Electronics,4,Great tablet - lag free when running apps... Good battery life. Only downside is lack of ability to screen mirror. Was available on older versions but no longer
4020,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good.
4021,Electronics,4,"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
4022,Health & Beauty,3,"Love the price but for me,they just don't seem to last as long as my other brand."
4023,Electronics,4,"This tablet was a gift for my mother-in-law. She is technologically challenged and was able to set it up and use it with ease. Great multiuse tablet. The size is ok. Get the 8"" if you are like me and like a little more screamReal estate."
4024,Electronics,4,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.
4025,Health & Beauty,4,Is good price . and fast shipping
4026,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries and the price is great twice the life of batteries a dollar store....
4027,Electronics,4,Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
4028,Health & Beauty,4,I was skeptical of the basics notation but they do the job!
4029,Health & Beauty,5,amazing
4030,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,"For me, the Kindle Black was not a good fit for me. There are times I read at night in bed when my husband is sleeping. This model doesn't have a back light so I'm unable to read at night without turning on a light and waking up my husband.So I returned and went for a Kindle Fire."
4031,Health & Beauty,5,Unbeatable for the price.
4032,Health & Beauty,1,The package was open and had no batteries....
4033,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
4034,Health & Beauty,4,Have worked well so far
4035,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"it has great durability, but lacks great sound. The picture quality is just ok"
4036,Electronics,4,"Its a decent tablet for a really good price. it has lots of pre-installed apps, which only a couple are used by my son. He loves taking and editing videos, so the front and rear cameras are essential. Its a nice tablet overall, and I'm sure he and I will like it more once it is completely set up the way we want it."
4037,Health & Beauty,2,Do not last long.
4038,Electronics,4,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
4039,Health & Beauty,1,"So, I now have an angry 2 year old. A broken new toy. And batteries that I cannot trust. I put new batteries in the toy and it stopped working a couple days later. I opened it up to find some batteries leaked also ruining the toy.Edit: Amazon has made since replaced the batteries for me."
4040,Electronics,1,I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
4041,Electronics,4,"Got this item as a gift, receiver was very happy with it!"
4042,Electronics,4,I chose this one because of the price and size of screen to use as an ereader. It has not disappointed.
4043,Electronics,2,"Was looking for a tablet for my young daughter. This was on sale and had good reviews. After consulting with the sales associate with some questions, I decided to purchase item. Nice looking product, however, very little storage space.... after downloading a few apps... the storage was full and was required to buy more! Also, cannot play videos unless hooked up to wifi. Unlike the sales associate told me. Very disappointing!!! Would not recommend!"
4044,Health & Beauty,2,Does not last compared to name brands
4045,Health & Beauty,2,"Small for size,, and already separating from waistband. Will not buy again."
4046,Health & Beauty,3,"Great price. Not too amazing in terms of battery life, but I do not think that you could get a better deal."
4047,Health & Beauty,4,good product
4048,Health & Beauty,1,"Update 4/30/16:I've been trying to use up the last of the batteries and two more have been found leaking acid since the previous review. I didn't want to just throw them out but at this point is isn't worth the mess and damage to devices.Original Review:Bought two packs of these on subscribe and save in the last couple months. We play laser tag and the guns require 6 batteries each so I thought this would be a good source of cheap batteries for our 8 guns. I put these in about a week ago after having the batteries sitting on a shelf for a couple months. We played a game and then put the guns up. The next time we played ( about 3 days later) I noticed an oily liquid running out of one of the guns. The battery was leaking acid and it had run out of the battery compartment and was all over the outside.I get that it happens to other batteries as well, but that's usually after sitting in a device for months, not a few days. I would not trust these in anything expensive...and take them out immediately after use. I won't buy again. Sorry, no pics...I was busy cleaning up the mess."
4049,Health & Beauty,5,great price
4050,Electronics,4,"should have bought 2 at the sale price, fast, decent graphics great for reading ebooks best of fits in wife's purse"
4051,Electronics,4,"I wanted a device to browse content in a screen bigger than a smart phone, read e books and watch videos. Being cheaper, coming from a renowned brand, the latest 2017 Fire HD 8 had improved screen, memory, battery compared to its predecessor. Also, I found a way to install Google play store and use this as a normal Android tablet. Here's the link - https://www.howtogeek.com/232726/how-to-install-the-google-play-store-on-your-amazon-fire-tablet/.The device runs smoothly so far after installing all my fav apps."
4052,Health & Beauty,2,I've had several of these 'fail' long before they should have. Several instances of having to replace them much sooner that competitors batteries.
4053,Electronics,3,"I purchased 2 others for my 5 & 6yr-olds, and my 3yr-old niece enjoyed playing theirs so much I then bought this one for her. The included 1yr subscription to free-time is awsome for the kids! Parental controls are great, and included apps are helpful.The lower rating is because the charging port was extremely loose, as the cord falls out ALL the time! Very Frustrating!"
4054,Electronics,4,"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
4055,Health & Beauty,4,Good buy!
4056,Health & Beauty,4,good product
4057,Health & Beauty,4,"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
4058,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and last a long time.
4059,Health & Beauty,4,Very satisfied.
4060,Health & Beauty,4,Perfect alternative to super market batteries
4061,Health & Beauty,3,"Not the best, not the worst. Less life than some batteries but price is right."
4062,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
4063,Health & Beauty,1,Not sure why they won't recharge correctly. Second time this happened with Amazon. Going back to a brand name.
4064,Health & Beauty,4,"very good batteries at an amazing price, tip of the hat to amazon"
4065,Health & Beauty,5,Dura-amazon does a good deed. Perfect. Hight performance. Just like any other BRAND ( - not the Costco version they don't last!).BRAVO! Dura-AMAZON!
4066,Health & Beauty,5,The proof of their value will be how long they last once in service.
4067,Health & Beauty,5,All of the AmazonBasic batteries are great. i am stockpiling all sizes because i can afford to at this price and having these at the ready is highly pleasing to me the neat freak. i also suspect these are fresher than ones you pick up at other stores that have perhaps been in their warehouses for a period of time. i got some from such a source and nothing powered up and then when replaced with AmazonBasic batteries my battery candles lit right up. Great Buy and in good quantity.
4068,Health & Beauty,1,very disappointed in these!
4069,Electronics,4,The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
4070,Health & Beauty,5,great
4071,Electronics,2,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
4072,Health & Beauty,5,"Good product, service and price"
4073,Health & Beauty,2,The batteries do not last nearly as long as other brands.
4074,Health & Beauty,1,"I see that these batteries have lots of positive reviews. My experience has been poor. I put a pair in the sensor for an outdoor thermometer. They lasted about 2 weeks and when tested, showed very low power. Replaced them with a second pair. They lasted and tested about the same. These may work better in indoor uses, but they seem to not like the cold. I've had way better success with rechargeable."
4075,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This tablet has been very satisfactory in functionality. Good cushioning on the outer case (better than another tablet I had purchased previously), still pictures & video are pretty good. No problems with accounts, parental controls & wireless connection. Overall a good tablet for kids."
4076,Health & Beauty,1,don't hold a charge - have to recharge too frequently
4077,Electronics,3,Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
4078,Health & Beauty,3,Adequate performance. I just pulled 16 batteries from four night lights. Half of these were the AmazonBasics AA batteries. Not surprising until I tell you that that AmazonBasics batteries were the last to be installed and the other half were installed long before the AmazonBasics. I don't think I'll buy these again.
4079,Health & Beauty,1,None of the batteries work
4080,Health & Beauty,5,as described
4081,Electronics,3,"Its fast, connects well, every amazon aspect of life you could possibly want is on here. Thats what I didnt expect, it being my first tablet. Amazon gets in your face about all its promos and products every time i turn it on. Its so annoying. -But its very handy, very sleek, easy to use and connects quick to any wifi acess around. However its limited on games and its app store is c.r.a.p compared to android. So ehhh 50/50."
4082,Electronics,3,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
4083,Electronics,3,for 33 dollars its a great option. although it was a black friday special its perfect for kids especially considering the amount of damage it can handle!
4084,Health & Beauty,4,They work greatcame very late though
4085,Electronics,3,Well not as good as I thought but works fine for my children.
4086,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,He loves to play games and watch videos and take pics
4087,Health & Beauty,5,happy with them...
4088,Electronics,3,I returned this item because I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard with a case to go with it.
4089,Electronics,4,"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
4090,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet for my 3 and 5 year old and I don't stress when they get dropped because of the protective case!
4091,Electronics,1,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
4092,Electronics,4,I would recommend this Prouducts it had great full sound full sound with a conpack
4093,Health & Beauty,1,They don't last. I would not buy again
4094,Health & Beauty,4,So far hasn't been bad but there have been a few batteries with really low life span.
4095,Health & Beauty,4,great
4096,Electronics,4,We bought this for my Mother in Law for Mother's Day. She's not very tech but she's had no problem using.
4097,Health & Beauty,5,Good product and price.
4098,Health & Beauty,5,Work great at a great price
4099,Electronics,4,"We recently bought this tablet for my 3 year old son and he loves it! It is easy to use, have lots of apps available, the cover is durable and it comes with a 2 year warranty! The only problem for us is the battery won't last.. Overall an amazing tablet!"
4100,Health & Beauty,4,You get a lot for a great price! I mainly just use them for my xbox one controller and they last for quite a long time!
4101,Electronics,4,You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
4102,Health & Beauty,5,"When I think of all of the money that I've spent so far on batteries, I am actually a bit furious! I buy batteries for all sorts of things for my family. And to think, these batteries were here all along, and I should've bought them along time ago! Amazon basics batteries are definitely worth the buy! not only do you get the size that you need when you need it, you get enough in a simple package that meets the demands that you need, easier open, and, worth the price! For the same amount of batteries that you get even in the smaller package, you would pay quite a bit more for the larger more popular brands that are out there. These batteries perform just like the others!These of been tested in everything from small toys, two Xbox controllers. Please do not die unexplainably or unexpectedly and they just plain work!I'm ordering a larger package I think but the Subscribe and Save option is great for monthly restocking or a staple item used all the time!"
4103,Health & Beauty,1,They fail earlier than brand names. I assumed Amazon would match in beat others. I won't order again.
4104,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 5 year old loves her Kids Fire Edition Kindle! Very easy for her to use.
4105,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal for rechargeable. They all work and seem to preform well.
4106,Health & Beauty,5,Great value.
4107,Health & Beauty,5,I love it.
4108,Electronics,4,I am familiarizing my self with no conclusion to say something about it now.
4109,Electronics,4,"It's easy to use. I can check my email, play games from AppStore, headlines news, amazon deals & offers. Very reasonable price."
4110,Electronics,4,This was a birthday gift for a family member who loves to read books. Couple this with Amazon gift cards and the library is endless!
4111,Electronics,4,"..exactly what I wanted, but the battery drains FAST when on hands free mode."
4112,Health & Beauty,3,They're cheap for a reason - they don't last nearly as long as Energizer or Duracell's from what I've noticed.
4113,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
4114,Health & Beauty,1,Be Careful with this one - I put 4 of these into my TV remote and almost immediately had one pop. I could hear a sizzling sound within the remote and I immediately took out the battery carrier (I inserted them in proper polarity). One of the batteries was actually fizzling at the female end where it had split and was leaking. Unreal.... I've never had a battery do this before. I will NOT be ordering these ever again.
4115,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,I am happy so far with this tablet. It offers great protection for use with kids but is a little pricey for the lackluster performance. Great for kids.
4116,Electronics,4,"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
4117,Health & Beauty,5,As expected. Like the box they came in.
4118,Health & Beauty,5,Best value I've ever gotten on batteries. They last as long as a Duracell at about 1/8 the price
4119,Electronics,3,Got this for my 10 year old grandson. He really likes it a lot. This is good for kids to learn responsibility using tablets.
4120,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Limited activities for my son to surf the web and do the things he likes to do!
4121,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It doesn't get five stars because there is an issue with the plug in for the charger. It won't plug in all the way it stays loose and comes out. Other than that it's just with my grandson want it he loves it!
4122,Electronics,4,Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
4123,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
4124,Electronics,3,Great sound..easy to connect..problem is.. its not voice activated..so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it..that means it has b close at hand...
4125,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries are awesome for kids toys that don't have moving parts and only music. Also works great in remotes and things like that. Great value for what you get. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
4126,Electronics,4,"I mainly bought this so my daughter and I could skype daily, but the free time by amazon has proven to be very helpful for kids. The big foam cover is awesome if you have a destructive kid."
4127,Electronics,4,"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
4128,Electronics,4,Perfect for my elderly mom to play games and use for reading
4129,Electronics,4,"nice slim design, easy to hold, easy to set up. bought for my husband...he just likes to browse the internet. great for him!"
4130,Electronics,4,Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
4131,Health & Beauty,1,Did not fix my leaking water pump
4132,Health & Beauty,4,Great price to replace all those batteries in electronics. Seems to last about as long as the major brands.
4133,Health & Beauty,5,Okay
4134,Health & Beauty,5,Standard batteries at a better price.
4135,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal and good batteries.
4136,Electronics,3,"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
4137,Electronics,4,Amazon fire tablet is great and easy to use. Good value!
4138,Health & Beauty,5,as expected
4139,Electronics,4,"For the price, it's tough to get a better tablet than the Kindle Fire. It's not the same quality as higher priced tablets, and you're locked into Amazon's ecosystem, but if you're an Amazon Prime member and are looking for an affordable tablet, the Kindle Fire is a good choice."
4140,Electronics,4,"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
4141,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to be working out as promised. I just purchased them within the lst month and used reviews of others to choose them.
4142,Health & Beauty,5,Great value
4143,Electronics,2,We have only had this product for about a month and there's already a problem with the charging port. Having to send it back. My Daycare owns 3 of them for her own children and their having the same problems with two of there's.
4144,Health & Beauty,1,"Shortest life batteries ever, waste of money"
4145,Health & Beauty,4,They seem to have some good staying power and are cheaper than most other brands. I highly recommend as this box lasts quite a few months with the kids mainly using these for xbox controllers.
4146,Health & Beauty,4,Price was right and so far they are lasting as long as name brands.
4147,Health & Beauty,1,"May have been a fluke, but these lasted not even 10 minutes in two very different devices - a kid's toy and wireless mouse. Will just pay extra next time for brand name batteries."
4148,Health & Beauty,1,Beware these batteries - I just packed them up for returning hated to have to do so but they lasted only 5 hours in tiny flashlights for my grand kids !!! Big disappointment too - won't buy this brand batteries again...nor do I recommend them to anyone out there !
4149,Health & Beauty,2,"I tried these thinking they were much less expensive than the brand name batteries and they would likely last a similar amount of time. I was wrong. I primarily use these in remote controls. While I don't have specific test results, the Duracell batteries would last well over a year in my Dish Remote. I purchased these in February and have already replaced the batteries twice. Perhaps I ended up with a bad batch, but I won't be trying these again."
4150,Health & Beauty,5,excellent price for these batteries.
4151,Electronics,3,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
4152,Health & Beauty,4,They Work as a normal battery would I would compare them to Duracell in lifecycle.
4153,Health & Beauty,3,"Came with only 12 of the 36 batteries in the box. Someone can't count. Two previous orders came with all 36, which warrants a 3 rating overall I suppose."
4154,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
4155,Health & Beauty,5,They do the job.
4156,Electronics,4,Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
4157,Electronics,3,"With the recent promotion for the Amazon Fire HD8 tablet, I just had to get one. It's been a while since I bought a tablet and the one I currently have is getting to be very slow.The tablet will come with a micro USB charging/data cable and a wall adapter.The tablet itself has some weight to it compared to the kindle tablets but won't be a problem if you use it to read sitting up. Initial setup was very straight forward. Once you connect to the WiFi and login to your Amazon account, you should be in the FireOS interface. The tablet is bundled with Amazon apps so everything is just a few swipes away on the screen. The interface itself, is very smooth so I didn't notice any lags at all. I did try a few games and there were some that were a bit slow at times and this was expected from a tablet at this price range. I will mainly use it to browse online and watch videos so don't see this as a huge setback.The buttons, charging port and headphone jack are all on top which will need some getting used to since most devices I've used had side buttons for the power/volume and charging/headphone ports are at the bottom. To the left side are two speakers and there's a micro SD card slot on the right for those who need more memory. The memory card option will be handy since this tablet is only 16GB and I think you have about 11-12GB free out of the box."
4158,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries....lol
4159,Electronics,4,"This was a great tablet, but I downgraded to the 8gb because it was cheaper and I could expand the memory at any time."
4160,Electronics,4,"I had an old Sony e-reader that I loved but it wasn't working too well anymore. I decided that a Kindle was the only viable replacement on the market right now. (Looked at Kobo also). So far, I like it. Great screen, backlight on mine doesn't have the problems that others have complained about."
4161,Health & Beauty,5,Received on time and worked as advertised.
4162,Health & Beauty,5,Good product.
4163,Health & Beauty,1,They last a very short time once in use. Put fresh ones in a soap dispenser and they lasted 8 days. Other brand lasted 2 months
4164,Health & Beauty,4,good
4165,Health & Beauty,5,Easier than going to the store
4166,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries at a great price. Very comparable to Costco batteries.
4167,Health & Beauty,5,"Works great and lasts awhile. If you play xbox constantly, They last for about a week. Would recommend."
4168,Electronics,3,I wish it has some more of the apps from the play store some are just not there
4169,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, great packaging."
4170,Electronics,4,"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
4171,Health & Beauty,5,great product for a great price
4172,Health & Beauty,5,They're cheap and seem to last just as long as any big brand. Would buy again.
4173,Electronics,4,"The tablet itself works great, but be aware, this is one that comes with ads as your home screen... nowhere did it say that it had ads..."
4174,Electronics,4,Easy for a 5 year old to learn.. the apps on the Tablet are very good.
4175,Health & Beauty,4,as good as Duracell and the Bunny
4176,Health & Beauty,5,Nice cheap batteries that seem to last just as long as name brand ones.
4177,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"The grandkids love this tablet, easy for them to use"
4178,Health & Beauty,5,"Really good deal, the batteries are high quality too."
4179,Health & Beauty,4,the batteries were fine.
4180,Health & Beauty,4,"Yes, I'm using these and they are as good as any other battery."
4181,Health & Beauty,5,no issues
4182,"Electronics,Media",3,"Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle."
4183,Electronics,4,Our 4 year old granddaughter loves playing the games on the tablet. There is a great variety for her to choose from. She also loves taking pictures with it.
4184,Health & Beauty,5,great
4185,Electronics,2,The battery is having more and more trouble holding a charge. I bought the Fire in July and am now having to charge it every day in order to use it. I am not impressed and would not repurchase it.
4186,Electronics,4,"Works well, some issues with installing Google Play apps. Great battery life"
4187,Health & Beauty,4,"OK for general use, fairly cheap, esp compared to lithium. Consumer Reports lists Kirkland from Cosco as better performers and about the same price. I'm gonna try them next. Of course being delivered to your door in a hurry is always great."
4188,Health & Beauty,4,good battery
4189,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"This is my second Kindle and I love it! It's so convenient to be able to carry around hundreds of books without the bulk and weight of literally carrying around hundreds of books. I just wish I could have bought accessories at Best Buy. Also, the sales rep knew nothing about the devices and had to 'Goggle' info on her phone."
4190,Health & Beauty,3,they ARE BATTERIES get real
4191,Electronics,4,I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
4192,Health & Beauty,5,Love it
4193,Electronics,4,"I have been holding off buying one of these for years, but on black friday the price was an astonishing $49. The amount of tablet you get for that amount of money is unrivaled. It is a great investment if you enjoy books or media."
4194,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for this item.
4195,Electronics,4,With the Amazon fire tablet you get everything you would expect in a high-end tablet for less than $100. That's hard to beat!
4196,Health & Beauty,2,After several months of use the batteries have proven unreliable for production use in microphones. Duracell and Energizer are much more dependable have a reliable run-down pattern.However they work fine for in-home toys and games where you want cheap batteries on the shelf for instant replacement.
4197,Health & Beauty,5,so far so good for what you get for the price
4198,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,First kindle debated between this one I got and the back lit version. Very pleased It's compact easy to tote. Using at the beech this week. I have Amazon prime so I get free downloads on books . It is easy to use . I think I would definitely recommend this product to others.
4199,Health & Beauty,5,Great price point and reviews for item.
4200,Health & Beauty,4,does what its suppose to do but doesn't really seem to have a lot of juice in them
4201,Health & Beauty,4,Just started using these batteries. Will update later regarding how long they last.
4202,Electronics,4,I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
4203,Electronics,4,Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
4204,Electronics,4,This was purchased for a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves being able to read her books on the device as well as being able to use Alexa. Very pleased with it.
4205,Electronics,4,Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
4206,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
4207,Health & Beauty,3,ok
4208,Health & Beauty,3,As good as any other battery
4209,Health & Beauty,5,To soon to comment on how long the battery power would last.
4210,Health & Beauty,4,It work
4211,Health & Beauty,5,"Another great product from amazon. I also use their rechargeable AA batteries which last a lot longer than any Energizer or Duracell that I have ever used. When it comes to any common battery size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), I will only be using AmazonBasics. Give this product a try and you won't be disappointed. You can't beat the price and/or quality."
4212,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
4213,Electronics,4,Great sound. Love it. It's value is well worth it.
4214,Health & Beauty,5,"Great deal. Nice packaging if you use a lot of these batteries, remotes etc. I suggest this nice product."
4215,Electronics,4,"My granddaughter is very happy great for kids to learn , reading help"
4216,Electronics,4,"I love this solutions for my kids. I gave it a four star rating because in order to install Apps you just have to tap the icon. Well my Two year old and five year old went tap crazy, like a Kangaroo on a Pogo stick. Needless to say the ran out of room quickly. I tried to teach them to not launch apps that weren't installed but they still have a problem discerning what is installed and what isn't. Aside from this, it is a fantastic device for kids to play and learn with. I especially like the parental control features. I just wish they would put in a feature for controlling what gets installed."
4217,Electronics,1,Since I purchased returned couple of times now is dead I have to return it again. My first problem didn't paired.
4218,Health & Beauty,4,great speedy we'll see how they work
4219,Health & Beauty,5,"Cheap batteries, but they work great"
4220,Electronics,4,I bought for one of my children. They really like it. Simple to use and inexpensive
4221,Health & Beauty,3,They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal
4222,Health & Beauty,5,Love buying these batteries bc I use a lot of need
4223,Health & Beauty,3,Brand names are better. These were not very long lasting. You get what you pay for.
4224,Electronics,4,"Works great, good price. Would buy it again. Kids have great time with it."
4225,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
4226,Health & Beauty,2,"Maybe mine is a bad batch, had a serious leak on one of them, these batteries seem to last as long as duracells but duracells never leaked in my experience"
4227,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries work great. I would say comparable to top brands. We've used some for approximately one month and they are still going strong.We are currently using them in our game controllers and a clock...Will update as needed
4228,Electronics,4,The amazon fire kids is amazing .. great games already loaded tons to chose from . Able to have dual users where she can only play games that are age appropriate without accidentally getting into an unwanted app
4229,Electronics,4,this product is great for kids under 10 years to learn and grow. I like the fact that it is created with kids in mind
4230,Health & Beauty,3,"I primarily use these for my noise cancelling headphones and wireless mouse. Overall, for the price, this is an okay product. I do not get the longevity I received when buying other brands, but for the price and quantity it seems to all equal out. I would not recommend using them for vital devices nor rely on them in emergencies."
4231,Electronics,4,"Great Amazon tap, you can take Alexa anywhere. Love it, can do the big Alexa can do and more! No know issue safer..."
4232,Health & Beauty,4,Did their purpose!
4233,Health & Beauty,2,Feel like these loose their charge much faster than the brand I used to buy. Will not purchase in the future.
4234,Health & Beauty,5,Great
4235,Health & Beauty,5,"Appear to be of good quality and are plenty bright, and hold their power well."
4236,Health & Beauty,5,Last longer than name brand batteries.
4237,Electronics,4,"Fast, fluid, and lots of apps especially once I added the google play store(very simple to do and doesn't require anything that voids the warranty). Display is sharp and video and games load quickly. I deducted one star as Amazon's version of android lacks the ability of customization."
4238,Health & Beauty,5,great value!!!
4239,Electronics,4,"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
4240,Electronics,4,Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
4241,Electronics,4,Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
4242,Electronics,4,"Overall sound is not as good as Echo, my primary source for Amazon content. However, the Tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock. It's portability sets it apart, however, it's nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting. Recent software update now allows listening mode. It does require a brief pause after saying Alexa wake word, but it does work. This drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button. The portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my Echo, which is fabulous!"
4243,Electronics,4,"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
4244,Electronics,4,I got it for my grand daughter's third birthday. The memory is small with the original purchase but you can buy more and I was okay with that.
4245,Electronics,3,"Tablet works as expected, Apple warranty is a joke. Read the fine print, they don't cover most problems with the tablet. Learned this the hard way"
4246,Electronics,4,"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
4247,Electronics,4,this was great buy & can do it all.fair price & great games
4248,Electronics,4,"Great little tablet, I upgraded my grandsons other tablet to this one, it was a good decision. Again the camera is not very good, but other than that it's actually really very nice! I would recommend this to a friend or relative."
4249,Electronics,1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
4250,Health & Beauty,4,Good price!
4251,Health & Beauty,5,perfect
4252,Health & Beauty,1,Wore out way to fast
4253,Health & Beauty,3,"these were under a light we thought they were there to fit the light when they arrived and nice company they were not the batteries we needed it should have been aa but that is ok,it was our fault not knowing this. thanks.."
4254,Electronics,4,"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
4255,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries. AAA. They fit and work in objects requiring AAA batteries.*Not for internal consumption.
4256,Health & Beauty,5,Good product
4257,Electronics,4,Love this product. Glad I upgraded! The features make it easy to read while traveling by car or plane.
4258,Health & Beauty,1,I was missing a pack of 4 batteries when I opened the box today. Not impressed.
4259,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries!
4260,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent product and seller. Product as described, fast shipping, highly recommend."
4261,Health & Beauty,5,So far these batteries perform as well as any other alkaline battery that I have used. The cost even beats Duracell at Costco so I consider it a good deal.
4262,Electronics,4,Easy to use. Great for checking out books from library .
4263,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I bought this tablet for my son and he enjoys using it the only thing I don't love is that u need internet to use most apps on it and you cant download youtube kids. It has a lot of apps though and a lot of learning material for all ages.
4264,Health & Beauty,5,Great
4265,Health & Beauty,5,Great Value!
4266,Health & Beauty,4,"Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops."
4267,Electronics,4,Great at home but still trying to figure out what apps work not connected to wifi
4268,Electronics,4,"If it weren't for the limitations of the tablet to just Amazon things, this would've been a great tablet overall.The battery is good, Display is decent for reading."
4269,Health & Beauty,5,"Best product from amazon basics,packaging is super good and easy to use"
4270,Health & Beauty,5,good price for this item.
4271,Health & Beauty,5,"I love stocking up on batteries at this price. Amazon, you've done a great job supplying the masses with inexpensive batteries"
4272,Health & Beauty,4,Good value for the money Will order again
4273,Health & Beauty,4,Used in flash lights they lasted 4 days before they started to dim a bit.
4274,Electronics,3,Battery lasts a long time but I actually like my old Fire more.
4275,Health & Beauty,4,"great value, hopefully these are decent power batteries. Says they are Alkaline so I'm hopeful. If these last well they will be my battery of choice from now on. Note they are available at great price as an add on to any 25 order."
4276,Health & Beauty,4,"I have not yet determined the useful life of these when in use. I installed four in my camera last week. I just do not know how long they will last, but they look good"
4277,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon items are best quality and price
4278,Electronics,4,"My daughter loved her new tablet.. it was, what we expected."
4279,Health & Beauty,4,"For the price, this is a great product. However, it definitely does not last as long as Duracell. Estimate time use is only about 1/2 or 1/3 of Duracell battery. Would buy again just because the pricing for the amount is still better."
4280,Health & Beauty,5,Good produc Great Price
4281,Health & Beauty,5,They work well and they are a great price!
4282,Electronics,4,this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
4283,Electronics,3,"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
4284,Electronics,2,"I mainly got this to have a bigger screen to read my news on. My favorite news app refused to open! Only good was that I have amazon prime. However, I returned the fire tablet and got the iPad 2017. Much happier with that!!"
4285,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing value!!!
4286,Health & Beauty,5,Can't beat the prices on these batteries.
4287,Health & Beauty,5,I am happy to report that this order is working fine with no issues. I am very satisfied with this order and plan to buy again from same seller. Thank you. Jn
4288,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
4289,Health & Beauty,5,They work very fine even in very cold weather.
4290,Health & Beauty,3,They don't last super long
4291,Health & Beauty,4,Great product .. fast shipping. Recommended!
4292,Electronics,4,This is a great little tablet for my son. It is easy for him to navigate through and it also has parental controls . I can control how long he uses it and what he reads.
4293,Electronics,1,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
4294,Health & Beauty,2,The package was delivered with only 40 batteries missing 8 batteries although it was perfectly closed and sealed
4295,Health & Beauty,5,Just as described.Fine product.
4296,Electronics,2,Tablet had trouble from the begging it kept restarting and rebooting I had to return it.
4297,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My 10yr old stepdaughter wanted a camera, but after Christmas, Best Buy was out of stock. We thought this was a good alternative (she gets $ from her grandparents, so it was her purchase) since she broke her old tablet as well. Due to her being behind 2yrs in school, we set a 2 hr limit - meaning she had to read or do other educational games for 2 hours before being able to play on it. We also set a max time so she wouldn't spend all day. It was REALLY easy to set this up & I wish it was this simple on our other kids' electronics. So, yes I had an alterior motive for moving her to an educational tablet in lieu of a camera, but some kids refuse to get outdoors. So far, a great buy!"
4298,Health & Beauty,5,They are batteries and they work well and they are a bargain! What else can you ask for :)
4299,Health & Beauty,2,"I ordered these mainly to use in a set of small LED flashlights. I tried the batteries in three different flashlights, but they didn't work in any of them. I double checked polarity and they were correctly installed. I tried them in a different device didn't work in that either. Amazon sent me a second set free of charge. They still didn't work in any of the flashlights but did work in a remote control and a toy. (I tried a different brand of batteries in the flashlights and they worked fine.) So it was hit and miss with these AAA batteries--2 sets of them. I've used Amazon AA with no problems."
4300,Electronics,4,great value for the pricing...black friday special
4301,Electronics,4,This was a nice upgrade from my first kindle fire but the volume is just not high enough !! I had to buy a wireless speaker for it.
4302,Health & Beauty,5,Product seems to be as advertised.
4303,Health & Beauty,5,Fast shipping and really good quality batteries!!
4304,Electronics,1,"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
4305,Electronics,4,"Happy with the purchase, found it on sale could not pass it up!"
4306,Electronics,4,"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions."
4307,Electronics,4,Good but setup to enable voice control only on iOS is unclear.
4308,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price for so many batteries, haven't noticed them lasting any shorter than brand name!"
4309,Electronics,4,"Bought for my daughter instead of an I-pad. Works well, love the Amazon Underground App Store, but battery life doesn't seem to last as long as older I-pads. Easy enough though for a child to use."
4310,Health & Beauty,5,Good Value
4311,Electronics,4,"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
4312,Health & Beauty,4,Great value.
4313,Health & Beauty,5,Quality. Convinced me to order the same for home.
4314,Health & Beauty,4,not the best batteries
4315,Health & Beauty,1,"When I opened the package there were only 17 batteries, not the 20 that I ordered and paid dor."
4316,Electronics,4,Overall a good First Tablet for a Child. I find it difficult to find a specific game on the Child User. The Adult User has a search feature. Not sure where the Search feature is on the Child User. My 5 yr old Grandson is enjoying the Tablet.
4317,Health & Beauty,4,"Don't last as long as Duracell, but you can't beat the price"
4318,Health & Beauty,5,Very good ..
4319,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, good price"
4320,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Item work well and was easy to read from in day light
4321,Health & Beauty,3,Great for small gadgets and remotes. Don't expect to run anythinh more. Could handle a set of battery power hair clippers.
4322,Electronics,4,"convenient, easy to use and grand kids all have one too."
4323,Electronics,3,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products"
4324,Health & Beauty,5,Easy to open and use.
4325,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries and long life.
4326,Health & Beauty,5,Great value for the money! We will be keeping these on subscribe and save
4327,Electronics,4,Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
4328,Electronics,4,i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
4329,Health & Beauty,5,Came in on time and work just fine.
4330,Electronics,4,"Easy to access the apps, but not always easy to quit. The device works good, but since it's the apps that make it what it is, more attention should be given to their operation. I was disappointed that it did not come with even a basic user's guide."
4331,Electronics,4,The only issue with this is that you will need to create an account for the child or you will have to add them onto your account for Amazon
4332,Health & Beauty,4,This product was exactly as advertised.
4333,Health & Beauty,1,Arrived and maybe only 1/3 of the batteries actually worked. The ones that did not work have little juice to them or some are just dead.Sucks because when I ordered AA batteries from the Amazon brand a while back they worked amazing and were of great price. These are cheap but when you factor in how many of them you can actually use this was not a cheap buy at all.
4334,Health & Beauty,1,"bought these batteries because the duracell batteries tend to leak, but these batteries i had to replace in five light sets that the duracellslast months these lasted a week. The duracells leak but only if you leave them dormant in the fixture."
4335,Health & Beauty,1,these batteries do not perform as good as the cheapest ones on the market.
4336,Electronics,4,We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
4337,Health & Beauty,5,ok
4338,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks
4339,Health & Beauty,5,You can always use batteries. I used these before and they seem to last pretty well.
4340,Electronics,4,"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
4341,Health & Beauty,5,It seems to work as good as Brand name batteries!
4342,Electronics,4,"My grandson loves it, uses it all the time. Its great"
4343,Health & Beauty,3,"The price is very acceptable, however, feed backs on file indicate these may be a trade-off for shorter life usage. One review stated having experienced battery content leakage. In any event evaluations must be based on individual usage over a reasonable length of time, so I'll reserve my decision on re-orders after first order usage"
4344,Health & Beauty,5,Working great
4345,Health & Beauty,3,I'll be paying extra for energizers they last longer.
4346,Electronics,4,Got this for my 3 year old son. He plays with it every now and then but it's good for introducing him to educational things. Glitchy at times but that's to be expected with how much it cost.
4347,Health & Beauty,5,love it
4348,Electronics,4,"My new tablet, is easy to use, it is also very easy to travel with."
4349,Electronics,1,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
4350,Electronics,2,"Bought it in order to watch NBC but the NBC app isn't compatible, so now I have a paperweight."
4351,Electronics,4,"Has so many games for the kids to choose from, I love that I can make different profiles for each kid to limit what they play"
4352,Health & Beauty,4,Good
4353,Health & Beauty,2,Batteries did not last very long!
4354,Health & Beauty,3,They die pretty quick in certain items. But decent price. Nice packaging though. I'd probably buy again just for remotes smaller items.
4355,Health & Beauty,3,For some reason none of these batteries worked. Not sure what was wrong this time. I've bought them before and had no problems. Luckily amazon took it back without a problem
4356,Health & Beauty,5,use in various products last some time arrived on time no damage
4357,Health & Beauty,5,these work great!
4358,Health & Beauty,5,great
4359,Electronics,3,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
4360,Electronics,4,Great tablet for simple tasks. I bought 2 and I have no complaints.
4361,Health & Beauty,5,Great supply at reasonable price.
4362,Electronics,4,My kids really seem to like this. I really like the ability to set usage times which helps them learn to budget their time.
4363,Electronics,4,I like that the tablet has child settings and time usage. Very helpful in setting time limits.
4364,Health & Beauty,1,Sadly these batteries are horrible! I hardly ever have complaints about anything I order but these batteries barely have any power and I've had to change them out many times.
4365,Electronics,4,We love this table for our 5 y.o. It gives him the sense of independence he wants and me the sense of calmness knowing I can control what he gets on and how long he can spend in screen time!
4366,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work just fine. Great price.
4367,Health & Beauty,5,First rate
4368,Electronics,4,as above but interface is confusing and swipes are sometimes not recognized.
4369,Health & Beauty,5,graat buy...
4370,Health & Beauty,5,They work great and at a good price
4371,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for ebooks and small apps. Kid friendly.I feel like it runs slower than apple products. But can't beat the price overall.
4372,Health & Beauty,3,as expected.
4373,Electronics,4,"Love it for my boys! We received the 6"" Kids Edition for Christmas last year. The screen cracked a month ago and Amazon promptly replaced the device without incident. Great 2 yr replacement plan! Shortly after that, my older son who previously used a Nook finally broke. I decided since younger brother had a Kids Kindle, that we would purchase a second one to replace the Barnes and Nobles Nook. I love the fact that I can control what is on his profile. I love that it uses a micro usb charger and the warranty was the biggest selling feature. My boys are 5 and 7 and they are not very careful sometimes. My son did however get a kindle with a Pink case because it was all that Best Buy had in stock. I wish that cases were cheaper and I would gladly replace it. Best tablet for this age and in this price range.Cons: No google play store, slow sometimes, have to re-download apps frequently when running out of space, lack of popular apps."
4374,Health & Beauty,5,Good product and price
4375,Electronics,3,"It's nice to have parental controls, but app grouping and bugs with apps hurts the experience. Parents will still need to look over child's shoulder to ensure games/apps are appropriate. Battery life is absolutely terrible."
4376,Health & Beauty,5,Good Item
4377,Health & Beauty,5,"I bought this for my dad, I buy Anker for all my cable and power needs, and once again, they did not disappoint. This is a must buy!!!!"
4378,Health & Beauty,3,"Cheap batteries, but they don't last long for me. I've been using them in my fire tv remote. I have to replace them every month. The batteries before these lasted for 6 months for comparison."
4379,Electronics,4,"Runs Great, very efficient for what we use it for."
4380,Health & Beauty,5,I love it. I trust Amazon products. The packaging was adequate.
4381,Electronics,4,"Tablet is great for kids and adult use. I purchased the tablet to use at school with students with disabilities. The tablet holds up well holds a charge throughout the week. The tablet offers games that do not require Wi-Fi or data. If you have a prime membership there are a lot of benefits when using the fire, for example free apps, free streaming movies & music, etc."
4382,Electronics,4,love the worry free guarantee since this has been dropped several times. with that being said this tablet hs held up
4383,Electronics,4,"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
4384,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries as always
4385,Health & Beauty,2,"A day or two after these batteries arrived, I installed several of them in toys and our small keyboard (which also has A/C power). The next morning, my son called me into the living room, Mom! There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off. (I wish I'd taken a photo of the puddle they left on the keyboard and table, but I was too focused on clean-up to stop and take a picture.)You'll also note that these batteries are darker in color than the product image that is currently shown. They came this way, and I'll use that difference to keep an eye on their performance/durability."
4386,Electronics,4,"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
4387,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Tablet is easy to use, however only allows 48 hours of offline viewing when movies are downloaded, then must be reset online again. This is an inconvenience. Other than that one issue, I am very satisfied with the tablet."
4388,Health & Beauty,5,I purchased these a little more than skeptical about how long these would actually last. But 100 battery pack at about 20 that's a pretty great steal and I figured if they run out fast well I have a 100 to go through. So I said why not and bought them. They arrived and I put them to the test since apparently all gizmos and gadgets require like 4 of these bad boys.I can not even describe how pleasantly surpised I was with these. They come in a card board box which is was nice and easy to store. The batteries are wrapped up into groups of 4's. They hold a fairly long charge so you don't have to change them out too often.
4389,Health & Beauty,5,Works good for kids toys
4390,Electronics,4,Looks nice can't wait to try it out! Great price for a tablet.
4391,Health & Beauty,2,These might be ok for remote controls and wall clocks that don't take much power. But don't expect to use them in you digital camera. The low battery warning comes on the instant I turned on my Canon 120IS point and shoot camera with afresh pair of these batteries. Within about 2 minutes the camera dies and won't restart without another fresh set of batteries.
4392,Electronics,4,We love this tablet for our 2 year old. She can operate it on her own and it has a great variety of educational and learning games for her. We love that it has skype capabilities but the volume for skype is very quiet. Overall great tablet for a first tablet for kids!!
4393,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought for my kid - 5 year old Kid. Worth a buy. Recommended.
4394,Electronics,4,"I bought this tablet, so I can watch movies while waiting for my wife when she goes to her doctor, I love the fact that it links up with my Lenovo with no problems.Strong yes to this product"
4395,Health & Beauty,5,amazon branded products are usually very good.
4396,Health & Beauty,1,These die SO fast.
4397,Electronics,1,I have had this product less than 6 months. It shut down unexpectedly and would not restart. I contacted Amazon and the only help they could give was to hold the power button for 40 seconds and when that did not work I was told to buy a new one. Quality of a product is measured in warranty and support. This product comes with very little warranty.
4398,Health & Beauty,4,Decent batteries.
4399,Health & Beauty,5,ok
4400,Health & Beauty,2,Drains out quickly like cheap dollar tree stuff
4401,Electronics,3,The Freetime so far isn't very intuitive and it looks like you have to be on the deivce. No web interface for it.
4402,Electronics,4,Brought for my daughter and she loves it. Wish it had more Google stuff on it
4403,Electronics,4,Bought this for a new tablet user. After a quick training session she caught right on.
4404,Electronics,4,"Nice tablet for checking emails, playing games. The camera is ok to fair for taking pics"
4405,Electronics,4,"I have the echo, the dot and now the tap. The sound is good. Better than the dot but not as good as the echo. The thing the tap has over the echo and dot is its portability. Which is nice not have to be next to a plug all the time. I would recommend it."
4406,Health & Beauty,5,NCIE
4407,Health & Beauty,5,Great item
4408,Health & Beauty,1,"I often buy Amazon Basic products, and until I tried their batteries I've never had a complaint. But these batteries drain faster than any but the absolute cheapest I've ever used. So no bargain there. You get what you pay for with this, unlike most other Amazon branded items."
4409,Health & Beauty,4,Batteries work as listed.
4410,Electronics,4,"The Fire HD is a nice tablet that functions well but doesn't meet the shear horsepower and feel of an iPad....but, at about 1/4 the cost, it fits the bill pretty well."
4411,Electronics,4,"I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
4412,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries and super cheap for how many you get!
4413,Electronics,4,"This was a gift for a 4 year old who was enjoying it immediately with very little adult assistance required. Haven't used it myself, but probably won't, its for kids! Good purchase."
4414,Health & Beauty,5,great
4415,Electronics,4,"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
4416,Health & Beauty,4,These night lights are worthless. They do not work as described on Amazon.
4417,"Electronics,Media",2,"I've always been a fan of the Kindle, ever since the first one came out over a decade again.I was excited about this Kindle due to the many premium features it showed - the all-metal finish, high-resolution ePaper display, backlighting, extended battery life, etc.I was significantly disappointed to see that Amazon pushes ads through the Kindle when you put it into sleep mode, and throughout the store options. Additionally, I was further frustrated by the fact that I learned there was a cellular version (available direct from Amazon) but not through the store. For such an expensive unit, to have ads with no option to disable them, seems unreasonable and like a rip-off. Additionally, the fact that this only supports wifi (not cellular or WhisperSync) makes it even more of a drawback and something I would not recommend to a friend - stick with the cheaper version.I also found annoying problems trying to get my Apple Airpod earphones to work with this device. Pairing took forever to finish or work (had to try three different times) and if the unit sits for too long, I found that I had to go through the entire pairing process again; they were not automatically connected and synced the moment I had both devices turned on."
4418,Health & Beauty,1,"These are awful. So far I've used them in my toothbrush, and have had to replace them 3 times in 6 months. I've also used them in my smoke detector and had to replace them within that 6 month period as well. Seriously I usually can go a few years without replacing batteries in a smoke detector. Waste of money."
4419,Health & Beauty,3,lower value as they last about one hour but good for a flash light
4420,Health & Beauty,4,Work great.
4421,Electronics,4,Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
4422,Electronics,3,Slow performance and charging port very low poor quality it gets frozen most of the times
4423,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is a great starter tablet. Purchased for my 6 year old, it has been easy to use. Only giving get four stars because there should be a better way to control purchases. My son figured out quickly how to purchase apps. Finally figured out how to put a pin on app purchases."
4424,Health & Beauty,2,"I thought I was getting a great deal, but I learned the hard way if you don' use them up quickly, they go dead in a hurry. Extremely limited shelf life so don't buy these in bulk if you don't plan to use them w/ in 6 mo.s. If your using them in medical equipment, I'm sorry to say I'm choosing another battery. I don't like bashing an Amazon product and there's always the chance I got a bad batch but in this instance, (medical equipment) you want power when you need, I had several groans from the bfrnd about his TV remotes eating up his batteries, I thought my wireless mice were eating them up as well, so I bought another mouse, but when I put 2 fresh packs in my ten's unit 4 ea. time they started out weak then didn't last 15 min ea.. set it's time to choose another brand of battery not the product your putting it in. I did test the one's I took out before putting the new one's in. I didn't think to test them before putting them in....."
4425,Health & Beauty,2,I have no issue with the actual batteries. They work fine. My problem is with the extremely wasteful packaging. The 20-pack comes in an oversized cardboard box with two slots for 10 batteries each. They could just as easily package them in a small thin cardboard box.
4426,Electronics,4,"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
4427,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
4428,Electronics,3,Not easy to navigate and download apps to the device
4429,Health & Beauty,3,Brought wrong size for the walkie talkies i purchased..but can find use for them
4430,Health & Beauty,5,Item exactly as described! Fast Shipping!
4431,Health & Beauty,5,great product love it
4432,Health & Beauty,5,A+ Great Product.
4433,Health & Beauty,1,I received these batteries today and looked at the date after reading another review and the batteries are 4 years out of date. Please don't buy these.
4434,Health & Beauty,4,"Good value on a good amount of batteries . They work fine. Not the best, but far from the worst . Would buy again"
4435,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent bargain
4436,Health & Beauty,5,great product
4437,Health & Beauty,5,Great Price
4438,Electronics,2,just okay! Product was for my girlfriend. Doesn't appear she uses it much except to steam music. Most of the questions I ask it I get nothing. I like Siri better.
4439,Electronics,3,Good tablet but not as smooth as high end tablets. It's limited to Amazon so don't expect to do as much as an Android or iPad. I like mine and will continue to use it. I recommend using one if you can before buying.
4440,Health & Beauty,5,love the Amazon Basics.. would highly recommend them to everyone..
4441,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the price and I love that the large count comes in a box.
4442,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries do not last or work well. Spend the extra buck and buy Duracell.
4443,Health & Beauty,4,"We have been using these batteries in some kids toys and they work fine. I haven't noticed them lasting longer or shorter than others. We normally purchase the Kirkland brand one from Costco, and these appear to be equivalent. Its great to have a large supply of batteries on hand when you have kids!"
4444,Electronics,4,Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
4445,Health & Beauty,5,Just as described
4446,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal and work as expected
4447,Electronics,4,I like my tablet. Been doing a lot more reading than normal with it. Only disspoinment is that my TV has automatic Chromecast and you cannot cast to it on my Toshiba TV. Works on others. TVs. I like it.
4448,Health & Beauty,5,"So far so good. I usually buy Duracell, but I trust amazon... sooooo I tried these. No complaints thus far"
4449,Health & Beauty,2,DID NOT LAST LONG
4450,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are the worst. They leak and they die ridiculously fast. I've replaced the battery in my kitchen clock twice in the past month. They last about 6 hours of use in a Wii remote. I usually like the amazon basics brand, but these batteries were a total waste."
4451,Electronics,4,"My 8-year-old grandson is able to access all the games he's used to, but also many new games and videos. He finds something new to do almost every time he turns it on."
4452,Health & Beauty,5,HAVE NOT HAD CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALL OF THEM WILL REMAIN IN GOOD ORDER FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME MEANING A FEW YEARS OUT.
4453,Health & Beauty,3,"They work and they're cheap, but Duracell lasts longer."
4454,Electronics,4,Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
4455,Electronics,3,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
4456,Health & Beauty,5,much cheaper and just as good
4457,Health & Beauty,5,Good basic batteries. Handy and inexpensive to have around.
4458,Electronics,4,I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
4459,Health & Beauty,5,great deal!!
4460,Electronics,4,I bought the tablet and it is very nice. I really like the night time mode to use before bed so you can still sleep.
4461,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my 87 year old mother-in-law who wanted to use something for word games, etc. She's still getting used to it but she'll learn."
4462,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries really last.
4463,Health & Beauty,5,Awesome batteries best i have used in a long time
4464,Health & Beauty,5,Have not used any yet but is a good price
4465,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
4466,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
4467,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries work pretty well. They don't seem to outlast Kirkland or Duracell, but they are a good value for the ."
4468,Health & Beauty,5,"Nice, won't run out for a while."
4469,Electronics,4,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
4470,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Got this for my 4 year old daughter, she enjoys playing games and reading books. A faster processor would me it better."
4471,Electronics,3,"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
4472,Health & Beauty,1,"I'm not sure if these are the same Amazon Basics batteries I purchased last time, the label is different. More importantly these seem to discharge faster or hold less power. I buy the 48 count box usually and its obvious to me already this box will last maybe half the time the last box did."
4473,Health & Beauty,5,Just as good as the expensive stuff.
4474,Health & Beauty,4,I purchased the pack to use with 4 walkies i had when we went on a 4 day cruise. Each walkie took 3 batteries. The batteries lasted 2.5 days of use. And i had to replace.
4475,Electronics,4,"Easy to use for my kids, and they really enjoy using it."
4476,Electronics,4,"Awesome tablet for the price but the only con is that you can't get google play on it, you have to use the Amazon app store"
4477,Health & Beauty,5,"Ordering in bulk for batteries makes my life so much easier. I have kids, and they always need a battery for something! I have AAA, AA and other sizes on hand all the time, and I love never disappointing them! They have tons of battery operated toys and games and Amazon makes it so much easier than running out to the corner store and paying double!"
4478,Health & Beauty,1,Wish I didn't buy these. Amazon does a lot of things well but batteries No. Not so much. These do not work for more than a moment. Lay the extra for name brand.
4479,Health & Beauty,5,price
4480,Health & Beauty,5,Works just fine
4481,Electronics,4,This tablet has been great. Although I recommend getting a memory card so you have no storage issues!
4482,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It's a good tablet and comes with a lot of free apps and a fantastic warranty!
4483,Health & Beauty,5,These work just as well as the top battery brands.
4484,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries seem like any other they work and seem to last
4485,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect and what a deal - very pleased!
4486,Health & Beauty,5,They are batteries what can you say
4487,Health & Beauty,3,"I haven't done any scientific research on how long these last compared to other batteries, I can only give you my layman's experience. I use the exact same amount of battery usage every day and have tried pretty much every brand of battery (I don't hear that well so I wear headphones for my television and I wear them the same number of hours per day).The AmazonBasics batteries don't last nearly as long as any other battery. My headphones start getting fuzzy about twelve hours earlier than they normally would with any other the batteries I've ever used. I went through this package a week earlier than I would a 24-pack of either Duracell or Energizer. In some usages this might not matter but for me, it just wasn't worth it to buy these."
4488,Health & Beauty,4,great deal for the price
4489,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Great buy, do a lot of reading and he no glear screen is awesome while in the sun."
4490,Electronics,4,I bought this for my almost 3 year old niece and her dad told me she loves it! It has really cute educational games on it and is pretty much indestructible with the case on it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the charger has broken already.
4491,Electronics,4,"I bought this tab as a birthday gift for my 12 yr old nephew who lives in India. It's very useful for him to google for important information over the Internet for his school assignments. Also, he can video chat with me using Skype.Rightly priced to be a kid's product. Resolution could've been better if its targeted as a kid's product. I think better resolution can reduce some pressure on eyes while reading documents with fine text."
4492,Electronics,4,Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
4493,Health & Beauty,4,Inexpensive however I do feel that the power doesn't hold as much as other batteries that are around the same price like Best Buy's Dynex brand.
4494,Electronics,3,"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
4495,Health & Beauty,4,Good amazon product.
4496,Health & Beauty,5,good
4497,Health & Beauty,4,"Got on a good deal, lasts as long as the name brands."
4498,Electronics,4,"Good size to hold while just lounging on the couch or in bed. The tablet does everything I need it to, good for the money!"
4499,Electronics,1,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
4500,Health & Beauty,5,"So far I have had no complaints with these batteries. I was hesitate at first because they were cheaper than your big name brands. I figured they may not last long. But I was proven wrong. They have lasted just as long as the big name brands, and they are a lot cheaper. I buy these for work and for home. They do not disappoint me at either place."
4501,Health & Beauty,5,Lot of batteries that work.Yay.
4502,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries die almost as fast as Harbor Freight free batteries. I expected top quality and got bottom quality.
4503,Electronics,4,"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
4504,Electronics,4,This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
4505,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries have great life span. Highly recommend. They last just as long if not longer than the top name brands at a much cheaper cost.
4506,Health & Beauty,5,Good price and seem to last.
4507,Health & Beauty,5,I am very pleased with the batteries
4508,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries have an extremely short life. Below Amazon's standards.
4509,Health & Beauty,4,"Lol, they work"
4510,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
4511,Health & Beauty,4,Didn't seem to last long
4512,Electronics,4,Wanted something with a kids mode on it so we could limit time and content. This works. Saw it for a really low price so couldn't resist otherwise we would have gotten the padded kids version.
4513,Electronics,1,This product wouldn't turn on nor charge and then store couldn't locate another one for me.
4514,Health & Beauty,5,A great product! Why pay more for batteries when these work just fine and are cheap! Thanks Amazon!
4515,Health & Beauty,1,Very little capacity. They last only about 25 as long when compared with other main stream batteries
4516,Health & Beauty,5,Nice price nice quality
4517,Health & Beauty,5,I'll never buy Dollar Store batteries again! D They're great. I'd put them on par with Energizer or Duracell.
4518,Health & Beauty,5,Will never buy batteries anywhere else!
4519,Health & Beauty,5,service expedited
4520,Health & Beauty,4,It's a battery and it works :).
4521,Electronics,4,Thought this would be a great gift for the kids and the price was right
4522,Electronics,4,"Battery life isn't great, but overall for what I paid it is a good tablet for my kids. I did inadvertently purchase the wrong color and when I returned to the store to exchange it, the store mgr was a bit of a jerk and would not allow me to do so, despite being Elite Plus and being under 45 days. That aside it's a good tablet, but I was very disappointed in the customer service issue."
4523,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to work fine.
4524,Health & Beauty,5,delivered as promised
4525,Health & Beauty,1,Had these in my wii for 2 weeks and the batteries leaked all over.
4526,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever....they work once and drain out...you try to use something again and the battery is dead!
4527,"Office Supplies,Electronics",3,"Got this Kindle Fire to replace a laptop that died. So far I have been very pleased. Finding new things that it can do. Not happy with the camera, but I might not know all the details about it yet."
4528,Electronics,4,It's a very basic laptop. It's a good price. It fills all the basic needs.
4529,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Wish it was a bit faster loading and browsing, but functions as you would expect for kid friendly product. I would spend the extra money next time for a tablet designed for adults but had strong parental controls"
4530,Electronics,4,My granddaughter loves it. She plays with all the time
4531,Health & Beauty,5,Love it.
4532,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries work as described
4533,Electronics,4,The kindle over all is great. There's only one thing I would want better and that is the speaker. My last kindle was louder. I really miss the louder speaker.
4534,Electronics,4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
4535,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This camera is a great addition to my home I really like it
4536,Health & Beauty,4,"arrived on time, first 4 I used had short life but remainder seems to have full power"
4537,Electronics,4,This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
4538,Health & Beauty,4,"Don't last very long, but hey they are super cheap"
4539,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
4540,Health & Beauty,5,cheap reliable AAs
4541,Health & Beauty,5,Way cheaper than the name brands and almost the same performance
4542,Health & Beauty,1,"batteries suck! brand new out of box dead or close too. Change smoke alarms every month and remote batteries every 2 weeks.junk dead, 3 different boxes and sizes of amazon"
4543,Health & Beauty,2,"Use these in a wireless BT mouse. Has about 30 less life as copper top brand. Good price, but most likely will not buy again."
4544,Electronics,3,"Bought it for my 3 year old son. Physically the product is amazing! Love the case around it, and how amazon replaces the product if anything happens, no questions asked. However, the software is terrible. I wasn't expecting much to begin with but its hard to consider this as a tablet when everything is limited. I only use it now to play movies from an external SD card, which cannot be played via kids profile"
4545,Electronics,4,"This is great if you have two kids and want to give them a tablet to play with. My problem is that my child is dyslexic and this is the lowest level reader that currently supports audible.com... that is the hardware supports audible. In order for my child to use audible I had to disable all of the family features and try to turn it into a reader... I was sad because there are lots of great family features that I had to disable.I did not use geek squad, I reached out directly to kindle support. Pre-sales, they could not tell me the difference between the free and paid family packages. I had to get to a senior person to help me figure be out why audible did not work and the to disable the family features ... even then, I could not disable the Alexa app. My child has full access to Alexa and the rights to turn on shopping.... kind of scary.So my disappointment is that Amazon does not make a kid friendly kindle that we can have audible.com on for my child's learning disability."
4546,Health & Beauty,5,great money saver! will repurchase when i get near running out.these are great to have on hand (especially when it always seems that you need new batteries for everything at the same time).
4547,Electronics,4,After I learned how to use the Fire it is fantastic. Easy to use and fun.
4548,Electronics,4,Great tablet for many uses. Purchased mainly for reading but have used it multiple times just browsing the web and social media.
4549,Health & Beauty,4,These are great! They work well. A great price too!
4550,Health & Beauty,5,Very good price.
4551,Health & Beauty,1,"Don't Buy! I thought it was a great deal initially, but these batteries are drained SUPER QUICKLY. I have one in my wireless Logitech mouse and I have had to replace the battery 4 times since November, that is 5 batteries in 2 months that is ridiculous! I have started buying the Duracell ProCell Batteries, I am having much better results."
4552,Electronics,4,I enjoy reading with my Kindle Fire. That is the reason I purchased it. Because I do not have Wi-Fi my use is limited.
4553,Health & Beauty,1,"The worst batteries that i have ever purchased. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. Dont hold a charge for long and you have to buy Amazon's rechargeable pack. Doesnt work with otber brands but doesnt work with amazons either. I got this huge box and about 6 (yes, 6) actually recharge. Spend the money on duracell or energizer. I have a 4 pack of durcell with a charger and still works after years of recharging"
4554,Electronics,2,"This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating."
4555,Health & Beauty,5,"Can't beat the price, no issues with longevity."
4556,Health & Beauty,2,"Never again will I purchase this. The outer cardboard box is frustration-free, but the batteries are tightly shrink-wrapped in groups of four. You need to cut into the wrap to begin to separate the batteries, pull them apart, then cut a little slice into the wrap around each battery. Then figure out how to pull each battery out of its little, plastic strait-jacket.Even if these batteries function well, the hassle of unwrapping them (12 shrink-wrapped sets of four batteries) isn't worth any cost savings."
4557,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I bought this for my 2-year old. She liked it for the first few days and then she went back to playing with my ipad. If I hadn't already introduce her to the ipad, I think she would have been fine with this."
4558,Health & Beauty,4,Cheap Quality Batteries
4559,Health & Beauty,1,"Put these batteries in led string lights on two wreaths, place kirkland batteries in another set of the same lights....guess what Amazon batteries loose their power quickly. Kirkland batteries are still flashing strong,,,,,,Amazon batteries barely blink. Sorry Amazon, love you but not these for me."
4560,Electronics,4,Great for the child. Unfortunately it doesn't have a volume limit setting
4561,Health & Beauty,4,Great performance!
4562,Health & Beauty,5,very good quality batteries.
4563,Health & Beauty,3,Dont last very long
4564,Health & Beauty,1,More than 1/2 have been dead out of the box. Most other Amazon Basic products I have gotten have been great. Batteries have been beyond sub par so far.
4565,Electronics,4,"This tablet is perfect size. Bought for my niece. We both loved the color! Only thing to complain about is there is a lot of ads? Even when you unlock the lock screen. Not sure if there is a way to turn them off? But still, great product!"
4566,Electronics,4,Perfect device for kids learning how to use touch devices. Great tool for learning.
4567,Electronics,4,"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
4568,Health & Beauty,4,I like that I can order these on-line with Prime shipping directly to my house in a few days. I use a lot of batteries during the holidays starting with Halloween through Easter. Not a bad price and they seem to last awhile.
4569,Health & Beauty,4,Good cheap batteries
4570,Health & Beauty,4,"Dammit, I ordered these by accident. Was supposed to order AA's, FML."
4571,Health & Beauty,1,Does not last as long as the good batteries
4572,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
4573,Health & Beauty,2,Poor life. Buy a known brand.
4574,Electronics,3,Why do I get so many POP Up Adds on this! Its a great product but it's always trying to sell me something!
4575,Health & Beauty,4,Worked just fine received in good shape
4576,Electronics,1,So slow returning mine for something different any suggestions
4577,Health & Beauty,5,great batteries - good price
4578,Electronics,3,Loved it! Great product for my 10 year old son!!!!
4579,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries.
4580,Health & Beauty,2,Very poor quality. Lasted on one week in motion sensor that is used infrequently.
4581,Electronics,4,I use this tablet as an e-reader and to listen to prime music at the same time. Great for this.Still leaning other features.
4582,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries rock. They have one of the best performance to price ratio's anywhere. We use large numbers of them to power microphone transmitter packs in our theater productions. Those are applications where they cannot fail. These outperformed the ProCells we have been using. I recently bought 900 of them for our production of the Wizard of OZ. They worked flawlessly. They are our new standard battery.
4583,Health & Beauty,1,they are terrible
4584,Health & Beauty,5,AmazonBasics batteries strike the perfect balance between cost and longevity. These are awesome.
4585,Health & Beauty,4,"Work well, good price."
4586,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,A little slow but overall good first tablet for kids
4587,Electronics,2,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
4588,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it. Fairly easy for him to use and me to monitor. Definitely recommend the case.
4589,Health & Beauty,5,"You know, I really like the Amazon line of batteries. At first I has hesitant on using anything other than Duracell, I tried these and especially for the price you simply cannot go wrong...."
4590,Electronics,4,I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.
4591,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are junk . i use 4 of them in my front door lock. i have gone through 12 batteries in less than a month .
4592,Electronics,3,"Not a substitute for an iPad, but a really good tablet for reading and minimal internet usage."
4593,Health & Beauty,4,"I was intending to buy rechargeables, but bought these by mistake. They work fine though."
4594,Electronics,3,"I bought this to replace an older kindle that broke. It has more features, like front/ rear facing camera and better resolution screen. I feel like it doesn't work as well though. The screen doesn't always respond. The Internet freezes a lot. The colors seem to be a little off. All in all, still a decent piece for the price."
4595,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon batteries are always a GREAT deal!
4596,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I love the kindle. I'm not completely happy with the sound quality of the speaker's. And, a month later it already seems to be lagging and freezing a bit. I have one music app, several books, and a few games on it. I don't seem to be using it as much as my 7 during long trips just because of the size."
4597,Health & Beauty,4,Meet expectations.
4598,Health & Beauty,1,"This batteries didn't last very long in anything we used them in (clock, toy, flashlights). Would not buy them again."
4599,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
4600,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries seem to work in some flashlights and not others. They are just okay. Other batteries that we have will work on all. Not impressed.
4601,Electronics,4,"Amazon Fire HD8 is a good tab at this price. It's light in weight, easy to use and serves a good purpose for browsing and reading. But if you are looking for a good camera or a tab for video calling, this is not the right choice for you"
4602,Health & Beauty,3,These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.
4603,Electronics,4,I don't know much about tablets but the sales associate recommended this one for me. It does what I need and more but I just don't know how to use it yet.
4604,Health & Beauty,5,Lives up to Amazon standards ..
4605,Health & Beauty,3,Great durability and long lasting at portion of price
4606,Health & Beauty,4,"Ive been buying these since they started selling them. The last batch, I had one that leaked. It was in a rather expensive candle, so a heads up for those using this battery to check once in a while. Ive never had this happen before. It turned all brown on one side and could have ruined my candle if I didnt clean it out real good. The battery was only week old, used infrequently in an air conditioned home. I will still continue to buy these."
4607,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are so strong it's like they have super powers!!!!
4608,Health & Beauty,5,Love these batteries. Not only do I not have to go to the store for batteries but they seem to last longer then most of the batteries I have bought in the store. We use alot of batteries between my boys and their toys but also for cordless mics since my husband is a DJ. The big test that won me over was when you do toasts at weddings and announcements. We are able to use a set of batteries for more then one wedding
4609,Electronics,4,It's a very good tablet for your child everyday use
4610,Electronics,4,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
4611,Electronics,4,Was ok till it fell off table landed flat face down the broke screen my granddaughter threw unit and didn't break but it fell then broke so what good is bumper on unit if that happens
4612,Electronics,4,Great tablet for the price. Add to that expandable memory and it's a great gift for the holidays.
4613,Health & Beauty,5,They worked
4614,Electronics,4,My son loves this thing. He is always on it. Great learning tool and it keeps him entertained
4615,Electronics,4,"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
4616,Electronics,4,"This tablet really help me out, as a great gift for my nephew"
4617,Health & Beauty,5,"I am a big fan of Amazon batteries! They cost less, last as long, and get here in 2 days with Prime!"
4618,Electronics,3,Perfect for that age group that I bought it for she 10and loves it.
4619,Health & Beauty,5,"Haven't blown up on me or leaked yet. No complaints. Plus, the price is right."
4620,Electronics,4,it's all i needed while away from my computer on the go and at work.
4621,Electronics,1,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts for our niece and nephew. We decided to unbox them and charge them up to be ready for Christmas day. After opening them, discovered they will not allow you to install any free apps or use them for much unless registered with an Amazon account and credit or gift card. I had absolutely no interest in giving a 4 and 7 year old access to one click shopping on my account so we returned these for android type kids tablets. There may be some way around this restriction, but I didn't find it."
4622,Health & Beauty,4,"What can you say, they are batteries and they work. Price was good when I purchased them.."
4623,Health & Beauty,4,I'm gonna buy some AAs on my next purchase.
4624,Electronics,4,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
4625,Electronics,3,"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
4626,Electronics,4,"I was worried that it would have lag, but it didn't. I got this to replace my Kindle paperwhite (Which I still LOVE), because I wanted to be able to listen to the audio on the books as well. IT's a great little tablet that does so much of what I wanted it to do. The stand by time and play time are better than I thought they would be as well. I LOVE the blue light filter, although that takes time to get used to it if your not already accustomed to that sort of thing. The only other thing I really don't care for is the fact you can not easily add Google play store."
4627,Electronics,3,This was purchased as a Christmas gift and I have not had any experience with it yet.
4628,Electronics,4,Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
4629,Health & Beauty,5,"Good value, Fast shipping."
4630,Health & Beauty,5,Seems to work better and last longer in our flashlights then the name brands!
4631,Electronics,3,Good tablet to take for my child to play on when out to dinner. Keeps him busy.
4632,Health & Beauty,5,good value for the money
4633,Health & Beauty,3,"Okay, but do not last long."
4634,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon Basics batteries work as good as any of the others.
4635,Health & Beauty,4,"These don't last quite as long as Duracell, but for the price it's hard to complain. Nice basic batteries. No issues except for slightly shorter lifespan."
4636,Health & Beauty,4,Can't go wrong with AmazonBasics batteries - quality at a great value.
4637,Health & Beauty,5,Great value.
4638,Health & Beauty,1,WORST BATTERIES EVER TRIED. VERY POOR battery life compared to major name brand alkaline
4639,Health & Beauty,5,"Great pricing, batteries seem to hold up well!"
4640,Health & Beauty,2,"Been using Amazon AA and AAA batteries over the past 6 months in a variety of electronic items and have found that they do not last as long as higher quality, higher price batteries. I guess you get what you pay for!"
4641,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for small kids because it is well protected and is preloaded with many games.Adults can also use it when required.You have to be careful what mode your in as your child may start trying to buy stuff on you!
4642,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
4643,Health & Beauty,2,They dont really last long
4644,Health & Beauty,5,"so far, so good"
4645,Health & Beauty,5,NICE Product
4646,Health & Beauty,4,batteries worked great for the price.
4647,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon batteries over good performance at a great price. Nice option to replace more expensive name brand batteries.
4648,Health & Beauty,3,"Good knob. Looks good. Logo faded/wore off in a few months though... logo is kinda why I bought this, so.........."
4649,Electronics,2,"The tablet works great when the battery is charged. The problem we have is the provided charging cable connector does not seat well into the tablet's micro USB port and does not have a solid electrical connection. Therefore, most of the time the tablet sits useless with a dead battery."
4650,Health & Beauty,5,no other way to buy batteries
4651,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries in bulk for cheap
4652,Electronics,2,I purchased the Kids kindle because of the warranty plan. Thinking it's the best deal for the money. I find it in no way user friendly for my ha me or my 3 year old granddaughter! She can take my iPad go strength to her folder.
4653,Electronics,4,"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
4654,Electronics,4,Excellent resolution and speed. I love the easy usability of the new fire.
4655,Health & Beauty,5,Lasts a pretty long time period.
4656,Health & Beauty,1,"Do not use these in any techy gadget, including remote controls, keyboards, and especially cameras!"
4657,Health & Beauty,5,"Very happy with purchase, very powerful."
4658,Health & Beauty,5,great price!!!!! Thanks!!!
4659,Electronics,4,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
4660,Health & Beauty,2,Battiers dont last very long
4661,Health & Beauty,2,Drain quick
4662,Health & Beauty,5,Best bang for your buck. All the batteries last as long as leading brands for a fraction of the cost. We've got 3 kids and we go through batteries like crazy over here. I cannot even begin to tell you how much money these Amazon batteries have saved us! Thanks!
4663,Health & Beauty,5,Best buy for your money
4664,Electronics,4,"For what it is, it's great. If you expect an iPad, you're not going to get it. It's a very capable tablet, and has a good variety of apps for the kids."
4665,Electronics,3,the amount i paid for the tablet is worth it on sale.
4666,Health & Beauty,4,i am impressed
4667,Health & Beauty,4,Good battery
4668,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent batteries with a long shelf-life.
4669,Electronics,4,Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
4670,Health & Beauty,1,These worked for about 8 hours and then were dead. What a waste!
4671,Health & Beauty,4,"For the price, I really can't complain. The life of the battery seemed comparable to other generic batteries. Great for remotes and other low use items. However, my son put these in a small indoor remote controlled helicopter and it chewed through them pretty quickly (which I expected). Again, good for the price and the right usage."
4672,Electronics,4,"This is the best tablet you can get for under $100. I have used or own many tablets including Ipad Pro/Mini, Samsung Galaxy Tab and Nexus. They are popular high-end tablets but easily cost over $300 or $400. I was very surprised by quality of this tablet and it gives you much more than what you pay. Battery performance is great- it easily lasts over 10 hours after charge. Speakers are solid with two drivers. Performance is decent although not as fast/responsive as high-end tablets. I was bit disappointed at its low contrast display. However for its price, I cannot complain too much."
4673,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD BATTERIES
4674,Health & Beauty,4,"I have not seen that these AmazonBasics batteries lose their charge any quicker than the name brands, like other off brands are wont to do. For the price, these are a better value than other multi-packs I have seen. I will definitely keep buying these as long as they are available at these prices."
4675,Electronics,4,Overall great product. 5 year old can use it easily and it is great in terms of making sure young children cannot access content that is not intended for them.
4676,Health & Beauty,5,great buy !!
4677,Electronics,4,This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
4678,Electronics,3,Screen larger than phone. Visual better...........
4679,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
4680,Electronics,4,It was a gift but they loved it. They love to watch movies online
4681,Electronics,4,Gift for our son and he is really enjoying it. He can read as well as play games.
4682,Electronics,4,It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
4683,Electronics,4,"Positives:Not overpriced and extremely user-friendly OS. Recommend that users purchase an Amazon Prime membership if purchasing this item as there are always a ton of free TV shows, movies, books, and games included in the subscription. Prices for items are also reduced. If not, there are occasional free and reduced price items; however, you have to look for them.Negatives: If you do not charge the battery on a consistent basis, there is a chance that the Kindle's internal battery will not charge anymore. This will require the user to return the item and purchase another. If the user keeps too many apps open, the performance drops significantly. The display has a low resolution and the touchscreen does not always respond as quickly as a tablet would."
4684,Health & Beauty,4,Works for me however jury is still out on how long these wilol last.
4685,Electronics,4,My 3 yr old son loves his tablet. He takes it almost everywhere and it keeps him entertained.
4686,Health & Beauty,4,Works fine.
4687,Health & Beauty,5,Outlast name brand batteries. This is a great product.
4688,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
4689,Health & Beauty,5,Only AA batteries I buy!
4690,Health & Beauty,1,"These straight up don't work. I have put 6 different, brand new batteries from this pack into a controller and none of them have worked. Steer clear."
4691,Health & Beauty,5,"Just as good as name brands, lasts longer and no mercury."
4692,Electronics,3,Basic tablet which is pretty good for its price range.
4693,Electronics,4,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
4694,Electronics,4,This tablet is a great option for a child as the padded case provides excellent drop protection. The Kindleized Android is very limiting though as you cannot stream to a Chromecast and many other things you can do with a regular Android tablet (Play Store). Space is also limited (even on the large version).
4695,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal
4696,Health & Beauty,4,good batteries!
4697,Health & Beauty,1,"This is my 2nd time ordering them and even though they arrive very fast and nicely packaged, these batteries only last about an hour and a half on my son's toy train."
4698,Health & Beauty,3,"I've had my Thea for three months so far and it is amazing except for some recent issues. The problem is now it's breaking (after only three months) and I have no clue why. It won't charge anymore and it isn't vibrating on full power. I'm hoping that Nymph will send me a replacement considering the lifetime guarantee. I'm kind of upset at how fast it broke though, despite how good of a condition I tried to keep it in."
4699,Health & Beauty,5,Great battery life for a great price.
4700,Health & Beauty,4,"Haven't conducted any testing so I'm not absolutely sure about how these compare for performance to Duracell, Energizer or Ray-O-Vac. Gut feeling is that they are about the same as Energizer and Ray-O-Vac in performance and I can sometimes get Ray-O-Vacs on sale at Home Depot/Lowes for a competitive price."
4701,Health & Beauty,5,Low cost solution that works...
4702,Health & Beauty,5,batteries job well done
4703,Electronics,4,"I replaced an old Galaxy Tab 3 with the Fire. It is taking getting used to, but I am excited to see how it works with all the Amazon Brand."
4704,Electronics,4,"Purchased this for our 8yo--she loves it! Had to return the 1st one after just.a few days as the screen would go black after typing in password--periodically. However, Best Buy traded it out for a new one!"
4705,Electronics,4,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
4706,Health & Beauty,1,they let for about 5 recharges
4707,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries don't last!!!!
4708,Electronics,4,It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
4709,Electronics,4,"Bought for my 5 year old. He loves it. Not a great camera, but has a lot of fun options. Love Alexa!!"
4710,Electronics,4,Download can be slow at times.Overall good product.
4711,Electronics,4,I have really enjoyed my Tap. Alexa responds well and I love the charging dock on my desk. The only downside is the app used for setup is not very good.
4712,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries but seemingly duracell lasts longer
4713,Electronics,3,"I was expecting an Android device and discovered it was an ""Android like"" device. My fault for not reading up on his device before hand. I returned the Amazon Fire and bought a Samsung Tab E.I probably would recommend this tablet if you wanted a device for reading."
4714,Health & Beauty,5,Work as expected.
4715,Health & Beauty,5,great
4716,Health & Beauty,5,grea
4717,Health & Beauty,5,I bought these for my Xbox one remotes because the other brands I would buy dies way too quickly. I was a little skeptical at first because I had never heard of Amazon Basics but I'm glad I tried them. I play the Xbox everyday and the batteries have not died within three weeks. That's great quality.
4718,Health & Beauty,5,Why buy any other batteries AmazonBasics does it again.
4719,Health & Beauty,1,"I had hoped that Amazon batteries would be as good as their other services. Unfortunately, either we got a bad batch or these batteries are not as good as other brands. These were ordered in April and it is now August and I have had to use three sets of batteries in my mouse. Normally a set of batteries lasts three or four months. I would not recommend. Others reviews are more positive, but I personally cannot recommend this brand."
4720,Health & Beauty,5,Very happy with this purchase.
4721,Health & Beauty,4,"So far, so good."
4722,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"This is a great product, my 8yr son is completely hooked onto it. The only change I would say it making the interface a little easier to use."
4723,Electronics,3,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.
4724,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This tablet is quite durable. The pink is vibrant and it's very easy for little fingers to hold. My granddaughter loves it.
4725,Electronics,4,My girls love the tablet. It has lots of apps they can download. The only problem the battery is used up even when not in use.
4726,Health & Beauty,5,Everything came as described and fast delivery (:
4727,Electronics,4,"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
4728,Health & Beauty,5,Work great
4729,Electronics,4,"I'm a Windows person & this is not Windows. I'm still learning. I am happy with the size as it fits easily in to my purse, but I HATE touch items - I always seem to touch the wrong area (like spelling something, I go for a letter & get one of the letters next to - so it slows down my typing - one of the reasons I don't have a smartphone). All in all it's pretty good. I guess I would recommend it because it's the way this world is turning. However, they don't make a glass protective screen cover - only plastic."
4730,Health & Beauty,4,"Gurfr ner onggrevrf ng gur evtug cevprf. Gung'f vg. Abg ernyyl, ohg vg'f tbbq rabhtu sbe zr sbe abj."
4731,Electronics,4,Overall very good product for kid. Much robust and easy to operate.Only downside is that it is sometimes very slow.
4732,Electronics,1,This tablet shut down and never turned back on after a week of purchasing it. I had to return it and they were out of stock for exchange. Annoying.
4733,Electronics,4,Love this tablet. Great price and does everything Iwas looking for in a tablet
4734,Health & Beauty,5,I couldn't beat the price on the AAA cells!
4735,Health & Beauty,1,"Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !"
4736,Health & Beauty,1,These are horrible! Don't waste your money. These batteries die faster than any I've ever tried. A few hours in a Wii remote and they have to be replaced. I'm so disappointed!
4737,Electronics,4,Great easy fluid tablet for begginers. Would highly reccommend. Excellent for all the readers out there too !
4738,Electronics,3,"I previously owned the Fire HD 7 and was excited about the HD 8. After getting the HD 8 and using it I started to notice how they were able to cut costs. The screen was not as crisp, the processor was slower and the speakers were not as loud as previous versions. Overall a good buy for the price but if you are expecting the quality that went into previous versions look elsewhere."
4739,Electronics,4,I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
4740,Health & Beauty,2,These don't work very well
4741,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries work great!!!
4742,Health & Beauty,2,"10 year storage life is a joke. I had some that I purchased only 8 months ago and when I went to use them, they already have zero juice left in them. I double checked with a battery tester and got zippo - zero. Not recommended."
4743,Health & Beauty,5,Great product and works great.
4744,Electronics,4,I am satisfied with my products. I look weekly for a good deal. I look forward to more deals
4745,Health & Beauty,4,"Very good, like to keep in stock"
4746,Electronics,3,"I got 2 of this for kids 5 and 3 it is a pretty good tablet, easy to navigate for the children but (and this is on me for not researching) but kid content is only free for a year, after that you gotta pay a monthly fee which is cheaper if you are a prime member, but still...Now reason why I'm about to return them! You CANNOT get YouTube kids at all! No google apps. You can get some YouTube kids clones on the adult profile and add them to the kid's profile but they stink. They're full of commercials.So I wasn't expecting this tablet to be like an iPad but this is a deal breaker for me."
4747,Health & Beauty,5,Quality batteries at a great price! Thank you!
4748,Health & Beauty,5,Work well
4749,Health & Beauty,2,"They last a day in an xbox controller, if you're lucky"
4750,Electronics,4,my grandchild really enjoy playing and watch videos on her Kindle
4751,Health & Beauty,5,Good stuff
4752,Electronics,4,Amazon kindle fire has a lot of free app and can be used by any one that wants to get online anywhere
4753,Electronics,3,"Bought this for my parents as they have an aging 3rd Generation FireHD. That tablet cost well over $300 dollars but was limited to fireOS 4. I couldn't believe that their newest only cost $50 on sale with ads. I don't think it is worth it at their normal price of $80 dollars.FireOS 5 is pretty much just a skinned version of Android Lolipop. Since we are on Nougat now, they are about two years behind. Hopefully security updates are still being made for the device.The biggest disappointment was the screen. If you buy this for reading books, they really need to go back to the old 3/4 Gen HD Fire Tablets, as their screens are so much better. They claim IPS on this screen, but I don't buy it. Colors are washed out and pixel density is pretty poor.The blue light filter they have is pretty terrible compared to what Apple offers. It basically puts a semitransparent color over the entire screen. If something on the screen is already black, why does it need to look blackish orange? I don't fully fault amazon as this may be more of a limitation of Android, but still...Also I can't figure out how to get rid of the adds for the red version. In the past there was an option to pay a few extra dollars and they remove the promotion. Amazon's website doesn't offer the red without adds as of this writing, but they do with the black.Side load google play store for more up to date apps as a lot of the amazon store apps are long out of date."
4754,Health & Beauty,5,It seems like these batteries are the only ones that my clock works with.
4755,Electronics,2,Not really impressed by this item. It is pretty slow.
4756,Health & Beauty,4,Great buy!
4757,Health & Beauty,1,"Disappointed... In my handheld Microsoft wireless game controller these last about 1 week. Duracell/Energizers last 3-4 weeks... Amazon needs to select a higher quality re-branded battery to sell as Amazon Prime. Amazon could dominate this market by simply selling, close to these prices, a 5 longer lasting battery than Duracell. DON'T PUT THESE IN ANY EMERGENCY DEVICE... like smoke detectors, emergency flashlights and radios."
4758,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet to download videos from youtube red and to be able to take the tablet everyone we travel to play the videos. But unfortunately this tablet model does not support youtube red and it definitely doesn't work without wifi. So that was a fail! I'm gonna need to figure out how to download stuff so we can run the tablet without being connected to wifi. Other then that it's good for your little ones older then 3 or 4 years of age. It's big so they might have trouble holding it up but if they sit down with it then all the apps help promotes them to keep engaged and interested to sit still. Great case protector!
4759,Electronics,4,Bought these for my children they love the camera on them. The last one they had didn't have s camera
4760,Health & Beauty,3,"I am a die hard Duracell and Energizer user for many years.. Truth is, these are good for normal use items, such as a tv remote, or other items that aren't on a constant drain. However, for long term uses on a day to day I still will stick with Duracell, but these are OK."
4761,Health & Beauty,5,well worth it
4762,Health & Beauty,4,"I think they are great for the price, if you want to spend more, buy rechargables"
4763,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries!
4764,Electronics,1,After buying this tablet for my grandchildren I was going through the initial setup procedure.That's where I was surprised to learn that after using this tablet for a year I would be charged fees to continue with the selected programs I used for a year.Time to take it back to the store. No hidden fees.
4765,Electronics,2,I habe the echo and I bought this one fort my son's room but it's not as user friendly. I wish I would've just bought the other one.
4766,Health & Beauty,5,"As advertised, a box of 36 AAA batteries. I have a bunch in my kitchen already, from when I bought a box (36) of Duracell AAA batteries last January. Well, I guess you can never have too many. A better deal here (Amazon) than the Duracell box, hope they perform as well too. Time will tell, have a great day."
4767,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
4768,Electronics,4,Purchased for young girl and she love it. Perfect for games
4769,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Great little tablet, easy to use for kids. Wish the battery was bigger. Overall not a bad purchase."
4770,Health & Beauty,5,"This is a great purchase. My outdoor cameras on my house them. Compared to the leading namebrands, I find these to last longer. I am getting four months per pair of batteries instead of three months with my surveillance cameras."
4771,Electronics,4,"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
4772,Health & Beauty,5,Works great
4773,Health & Beauty,5,Good deal
4774,Health & Beauty,4,Seemingly sufficient at a good price!
4775,Health & Beauty,4,These are decent batteries for a pretty good price. I haven't experienced any leaking yet. Would buy again. Will update if there are problems.
4776,Health & Beauty,5,Fine
4777,Electronics,4,The best reader from Kindle and I can surf the web as well.
4778,Electronics,4,"This is a great personal speaker. I have both the Tap and the Echo. The only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically ""tap"" the mic button to activate Alexa. The sound quality is pretty good for the price. If you can afford it, I would upgrade to the Echo."
4779,Health & Beauty,5,Good price Great batteries
4780,Health & Beauty,5,Thank you!
4781,Health & Beauty,5,Decent price and performance out of these AAA batteries.
4782,Electronics,4,Bought this for my son and he likes it. He is reading more now.
4783,Health & Beauty,1,"Terrible decision on my part to trust Amazon to make even a decent battery. How hard can it be, right Batteries don't last. Every device I've used them in began to have quirky little malfunctions (remote buttons don't always work or do what they are supposed to do, mouse randomly disconnects from computer, etc.). Maybe I got a bad batch -- all 48 of them. Lesson learned."
4784,Electronics,4,"Overall, not a bad tablet. The price is good and the features are pretty nice. It was bought as a gift and I can say that she loved it."
4785,Electronics,4,Love this one.It is my third kindle.My last one was a bit larger but it was a bit heavy.Love this one for reading or playing games.I can check my email and shop on line as well as take and store photos.I can also listen to music.
4786,Health & Beauty,3,"These are okay. They aren't as long-lasting as name brands so in the end, I'm probably not saving money using these. That said, I like how they are packaged so they take up little space and we only have to open a 4 pack each time while still having plenty on hand. This beats the big packages of the name brands where the left over batteries end up falling out of the package and scatter in the drawer."
4787,Health & Beauty,5,"Right product, Right on Time."
4788,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,My fianc√©e really enjoyes it! I would definitely recommend.
4789,Health & Beauty,4,"Reasonably priced, and I have had no issues. They are not eneloops, but they work fine for all the applications that I have used them in."
4790,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work very well at a great price.
4791,Health & Beauty,5,Great Products!
4792,Electronics,4,The product was on sale for Black Friday. Serves its purpose. Quality is good and I use it with my Chromecast.
4793,Electronics,4,"nice item, and cute. the tablet is difficult to navigate"
4794,Health & Beauty,5,"Nice, reasonable price."
4795,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
4796,Electronics,4,I enjoy my kindle fire had it is easy to use get it
4797,Health & Beauty,5,AOK-AS ORDERED
4798,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"The tablet is pretty good, I would give it 5 stars if you are able to download an use apps from the Google store, that is one of my only big complaint. And also how fast the SD card got filled with items from Amazon OS that's on the tablet without the user knowing. On the other hand, With four kids using tablets as reward time it helps the kids free time is awesome it useful"
4799,Electronics,4,"Purchased as a gift, perfect for small children! Easy to use especially for children's apps with the touch screen."
4800,Health & Beauty,5,good deal
4801,Health & Beauty,5,Great value for the price!
4802,Health & Beauty,5,They seem just as good as any I have bought from the store. I have used them for countless things and have had no problems. They came on time and it is great to have the convenience of delivery.
4803,Health & Beauty,5,Thx.
4804,Electronics,4,using it as a head unit in my jeep bought a rugged case and it works great
4805,Health & Beauty,5,Work well
4806,Electronics,4,"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!"
4807,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap but seem to last as long as the Energizer ones I was using previously
4808,Health & Beauty,3,They dont last as long as certain premium brands but they do OK. I wouldnt put them in critical apps like smoke detectors but for TV remotes and toys and all the other goofy modern distractions that regularly beg for AAs they are OK.
4809,Health & Beauty,4,I didn't have any issues with these batteries dying on me but I am hesitant to make them a staple since it seems like there are others who have gotten bad batches. I will wait it out to buy again.
4810,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries were packaged good and seem fine
4811,Electronics,4,It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
4812,Health & Beauty,2,"I use it for the roku remote and it runs out so fast, holds for about 2-3 weeks (just like the chineese batteries),"
4813,Health & Beauty,5,I love that it comes in a box. So smart for batteries. You don't have a lot of loose batteries like you do once you open a blister pack.
4814,Health & Beauty,3,"I had such a good experience with Amazon D batteries that I ordered some of their 2A batteries. The 2A batteries seemed much weaker out of the box. When I changed out a pair in my clock today, they had leaked and were stuck together. Making it difficult to remove them. I looked at the packaging for the new ones and noticed that they were made in Indonesia. After reading the reviews, it seems like it may be a matter of luck whether you get really good batteries for the price or really bad batteries at any price. I like to play blackjack so I will probably order one more time to see how lucky I get."
4815,Electronics,4,"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
4816,Electronics,4,Tablet good for kids and some adults. Price and screen resolution were also a selling point.
4817,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for the cost, does all the basic functions great. These are email, web surfing, and social media. If you belong to Amazon Prime then it's even better since this thing makes it easy to take advantage of the extra content you can access. Movies, TV Shows, music, books. A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8. The weakest thing is the camera, it adequate but you smart phone is better. A feature it has that the iPad lacks is the ability to add an Micro SD Card for extra space. It is also much cheaper than an iPad."
4818,Health & Beauty,3,Two of the batteries were already dead. The rest work fine.
4819,Health & Beauty,4,"I love the volume price, but these batteries don't seem to last as long as the Dollar General alkaline batteries I typically purchase."
4820,Health & Beauty,5,You can not beat the price and it is by a trusted name.
4821,Electronics,4,Nice for kids. Like the free apps built in the device. Can control what and how long they get to use screen time
4822,Electronics,4,"We bought this to replace a Kindle Fire pad and they have come a long way in this build, I would recommend this or if you like a bigger one then get then10"" version."
4823,Health & Beauty,3,Their batteries
4824,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My granddaughter is really enjoying this tablet and even though she is only three she is able to easily use it
4825,Electronics,4,"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
4826,Health & Beauty,4,Good for the price. Last longer then DollarTree batteries and cost about the same.
4827,Health & Beauty,4,Good value.
4828,Electronics,4,One of the best tablets. Good for watching YouTube and reading as well.
4829,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,Not able to play youtube that's what my daughter likes.
4830,Health & Beauty,5,As shown.
4831,Health & Beauty,1,Spend the money and buy a name brand. These seriously do not work at all. Such a waste of money
4832,Health & Beauty,5,good fresh would reorder
4833,Electronics,3,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better
4834,Electronics,4,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
4835,Health & Beauty,2,Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase.......
4836,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and work great!
4837,Health & Beauty,1,Every single battery leaked battery acid after the first few charges or uses. Some while in the device it was powering and others while in the charging station. I thought perhaps it could be the charging station I was using so I purchased another brand but it didn't make a difference. I also never left the batteries in the charger once they were fully charged. This happened with the AAA batteries I purchased as well. And when I say leaked battery acid I'm talking about literal puddles of acid that would pool under the charging station or begin leaking from the device. I had to throw away a few children's toys as well as an xbox 1 controller. The skin on the tips of my fingers peeled away a few times as well from overexposure to the battery acid after having to clean so many surfaces and devices from it getting everywhere. Please don't buy this product They are completely ineffective and its simply an unsafe product. All in all purchasing these batteries cost me around 100+ in having to buy replacements for the devices they ruined.
4838,Electronics,4,Got this as a gift for my mother and she's satisfied
4839,Health & Beauty,2,Don't last nearly as long as major brands.
4840,Health & Beauty,5,I mean... they work.
4841,Electronics,4,Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
4842,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and would recommend them to anyone!
4843,Health & Beauty,1,Ordered these batteries along with a wall mounted mirror. Upon inserting these batteries the light did not work. Thinking something was wrong with the mirror. I decided to go to Target and buy more batteries. Replacing your batteries my light now works. I would return them but the return date was past due. Thanks for your time.
4844,Electronics,4,Great for little kids the case on it is amazing. My daughter loves it. Only thing I would change is the sound a little louder and screen a little bigger.
4845,Electronics,4,This was a great purchase and would definitely buy this again. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is a programmer glitch. They need to fix screen where little ones can't stop or change icons while they are watching or playing games. Frustrating for two year old to stop cartoons by accidentally touching screen
4846,Electronics,4,Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
4847,Health & Beauty,5,They worked and great price.
4848,Health & Beauty,5,Great.
4849,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal!
4850,Electronics,4,overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
4851,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
4852,Electronics,4,Good price. Works well. Best Buy sales associate was very helpful in selecting this product.
4853,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect!
4854,Electronics,4,Need to have better info for special needs children. The kids utube is confusing but love the guarantee
4855,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries that seem to operate just fine at a great price.
4856,Health & Beauty,1,"I bought this product from amazon about a month ago, the reviews seemed great so I gave them a try.After using the batteries in my Xbox One controllers for about 2 weeks, the controller began to malfunction.Upon further inspection, I checked the batteries, and the compartment was a little bit wet, so I cleaned it up and went to get new batteries (still in the plastic wrapper) and all of the batteries had an oily residue around them (some type of leakage) .Overall, dont save money here as you might lose your equipment and the money you spend on the batteries."
4857,Electronics,4,This tablet was an upgrade from the Nabi Jr for my 4 year old and she really enjoys it. There are so many apps/books/videos and it entertains her much more. The only thing i would recommend is getting an additional storage product since there isnt much internally.
4858,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks great product
4859,Electronics,4,Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
4860,Health & Beauty,5,"So far, they last as long or longer than the national brands."
4861,Electronics,4,"thought rice was a little high but now that i have one, it is worth every penny. have not had any problems with it and not bothered by not having a backlight"
4862,Electronics,3,"Perfect for children or for someone that is curious about trying something that isn‚Äôt an Apple iOS. Also great for someone that has an Amazone Prine memberships. If you want the FULL Android experience though, you should get a different tablet. You get what you pay for."
4863,Health & Beauty,5,work very well
4864,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter. Great variety of apps, books, and educational videos for her to explore. Love the features that allow us to control her time spent on it. My only complaint is that its processing speed is quite slow getting between different menus but at this price and for a 3-year old I can't complain too much."
4865,Health & Beauty,2,"I use these for my son's Thomas and friends trains, and they didn't last very long. Maybe 2 days at the most. Won't be ordering these again."
4866,Electronics,3,Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
4867,Electronics,4,Good tablet for younger kids as it keeps them occupied in many ways.and great learning tool.
4868,Health & Beauty,5,"Good product, good price"
4869,Electronics,4,Ordered one for my daughter. It's the fourth Kindle we have bought and love them. Perfect for watching videos and movies.
4870,Electronics,4,Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
4871,Health & Beauty,3,Great price.
4872,Health & Beauty,3,How do I rate this I really can't tell because I am not going to test every single one of them!
4873,Health & Beauty,5,I have never been disappointed by any of the Amazon products.
4874,Electronics,4,"The tablet is great overall. Its fast, smooth and many options to check out with regards to apps and programs. Great also if you have an Amazon account and also Kindle as well."
4875,Health & Beauty,4,"There are many batteries in the box for the amount of money you pay. Batteries at the store would cost way more. They seem to be packaged well, and conveniently. I took one star off because these batteries do not seem to last as long as the more expensive batteries, but it could just be the pack that i used. I will see how the rest will work out, but for the money, i think it is a good deal."
4876,Health & Beauty,4,"These batteries are a great value. I got the 48 pack and for the most part, the did not disappoint. However, there were a few that did not work. Then again, i've always been pleased with Amazon's products and will continue to use them."
4877,Health & Beauty,4,Ok
4878,Health & Beauty,1,Everyone read the 1 star reviews..the 5 star reviews must be people reviewing immediately. The 10 year promise is crap. I have 48 AA and 36 AAA batteries that are all dead after 1 year. The Dollar Tree batteries are better. Pay the extra money and don't fall for Amazons broken promises or guarantees.
4879,Health & Beauty,2,After less than 6mos I started seeing a lot of leakage.
4880,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries
4881,Electronics,4,"This Fire tablet is overall a good size, and has great features!"
4882,Electronics,4,"Works great for anything from games to movies, nice big screen to enjoy anything you are doing with it."
4883,Electronics,4,No instructions on adding the memory card and how to move things to the card vs on internally.
4884,Health & Beauty,5,Quality batteries for a fraction of the price of others
4885,Electronics,4,I got it for my daughter for christmas. She's very happy with it. I'm surprised how easy it is to use. It could have been 5 stars but the camera quality is not that great. But for the price I got it for it's good enough.
4886,Electronics,4,"My kids enjoy this tablet, as do I! The only downfall so far is the brightness does not dim very much, even on the lowest setting so my kids are not allowed to use it in be.Also uses a ton of memory, even though no additional applications have been downloaded since purchased and no photos taken."
4887,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I would recommend this to a friend is anybody with little kids
4888,Health & Beauty,5,Very good.
4889,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my sister after her child stepped on her laptop and broke the screen! She is in love with it - it's just the right size for her to do her photo editing, surf the web, watch videos, etc. It's quite durable as well - seeing as how a four-year-old has his hands on it quite often :)The only thing that could be improved is the camera quality - but we didn't buy it to take pictures with. Just to edit them!"
4890,Health & Beauty,5,"As good as first quality batteries, and less expensive!"
4891,Health & Beauty,4,ok
4892,Health & Beauty,3,"This battery is fine, but I purchased it because I thought it was rechargeable. Shame on me for not noticing, but I thought it looked just like the rechargeable ones I had purchased before. I bought it on Prime Day for about 6, so I thought I was just getting a great deal.Disappointing. I don't normally buy regular batteries, as we go thought them like water in all of our Thomas trains and other toys. I wish I had noticed the difference."
4893,Electronics,3,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
4894,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries...what can you say
4895,Health & Beauty,1,During my first recharging they were leaking and wrapping was coming off. A waste of money
4896,Electronics,4,Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
4897,Health & Beauty,3,"Packaging warning. The batteries are fine but the batteries themselves come pre-wrapped in groups of four! Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment."
4898,Electronics,4,Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
4899,Health & Beauty,3,They work
4900,Health & Beauty,3,"My bluetooth mouse and keyboard eat batteries, so I liked the idea of a big pack that I could just leave in my desk. These batteries are pretty woeful, though, lasting only about 1/2 as long as the Duracells I get in the grocery store."
4901,Electronics,4,"I'm not very good with electronics, so I was worried about learning how to use my Kindle Fire. I had no problems at all with navigation of this device. I feel it's also fast I was expecting it to be sluggish. I think this is great for the beginner and is a great bargain."
4902,Electronics,4,My daughter loves her new tablet she does everything on it
4903,Electronics,2,"I accidentally cracked my screen on the first day when the Voyage was too close to my rocking chair and neither Best Buy nor Amazon would do anything to help. Well, Amazon offered $15 off purchasing the Paperwhite and that wasn't something I wanted at all. Now I'm stuck with a $199 broken Voyage. Not a happy customer. I realize it was my fault but thought they should do something more to minimize the loss and keep my business."
4904,Electronics,4,"Bought for my 4 yr old as a Christmas present. I turned it on, and set it up. Pretty sure she will love it!"
4905,Health & Beauty,4,"Seems to work well I haven't been using them long, but have not had any problems"
4906,Electronics,4,"Not very user friendly, in addition the camera exposure is not sharp enough. However a great tablet for a child to play with."
4907,Electronics,4,The tablet works good.. good price point .. would buy again
4908,Electronics,4,I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
4909,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries! So far no problem with any I've received, they do the job!"
4910,Health & Beauty,3,"I bought 20 and I used 9 in three Motorola Walkabouts radios.One the second use, after only two hours use on first, a battery failed. I was shocked at this. It made my Walkabout useless for the child-safety reason I bought it.Noqw I cannot trust the rest and I will use then in unimportant places like toys."
4911,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the price.
4912,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are as good as any on the market
4913,Health & Beauty,5,ok
4914,Health & Beauty,2,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.
4915,Electronics,4,Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
4916,Health & Beauty,5,Great for the price!
4917,Health & Beauty,4,Same soap as always but a smaller size than I thought.
4918,Health & Beauty,5,Great price
4919,Health & Beauty,4,Does the job but I would like to be able to recharge these batteries.
4920,Health & Beauty,5,reliable
4921,Health & Beauty,4,"Seem to work just fine. Just as good as the big name brand batteries from what I can tell, maybe a bit better.I like the packaging."
4922,Electronics,4,"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
4923,Health & Beauty,3,not crazy about these batteries. don't last as long as others for same time period
4924,Health & Beauty,1,Batteries were weak and didn't last a week in remote
4925,Electronics,3,I was hoping to find something universal to as a tablet but you get what you pay for.
4926,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries and they're cheap. Cheaper than the store brand. I am content!
4927,Electronics,4,I had an older Kindle Fire and thought the transition to this one would be smooth. I was even encouraged to turn in my old one one the spot. After cleaning up the old one and saving the old files on the cloud I thought....I bought this updated version to find that it does not recognize the old files....so much for it being saved on the cloud. Then instead of it having an ad whenever I turn it on....ads also clutter the screen with the apps. I was happier with the older model and regret turning it in for a credit....which somehow dropped $10 in value in the time it took me to prep it before I deregistered it. If you didn't have an older model you probably will be happy with this one.
4928,Electronics,3,Was a Christmas gift and I ended up returning it because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for.
4929,Health & Beauty,5,Can not believe how much I was paying for batteries before these!
4930,Health & Beauty,5,They sure are batteries
4931,Health & Beauty,5,Work great. No problems.
4932,Health & Beauty,4,"It's hard to love a battery. All I can say is they work, and they seem to last as long as any others. The price is good, so I'm happy."
4933,Electronics,4,I got this as a bedroom TV. The picture is great and the sound is good too. Definitely worth it for the money.
4934,Health & Beauty,4,good for the price
4935,Health & Beauty,5,great product!
4936,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. Love the price
4937,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Purchased for toddler to watch movies and stuff. He loves the apps that are available.
4938,Health & Beauty,5,great price
4939,Health & Beauty,1,these batteries don't last very long
4940,Health & Beauty,5,I'll never buy another brand again. Amazon batteries last! Quality and affordable!
4941,Electronics,4,"Good product, great price. Big improvement over my first tablet."
4942,Health & Beauty,5,"Considering that Duracell batteries are guaranteed to leak and ruin your device, these are an excellent alternative."
4943,Electronics,2,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
4944,Electronics,4,My Fire is compact and easy to use. Mainly used to read online books at lunch time. The battery lasts much longer than previous tablet I had and charges much quicker. very happy with my Fire.
4945,Health & Beauty,2,"The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic."
4946,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT QUALITY GREAT PRICE
4947,Health & Beauty,3,Did not last as long as expected but good value for price.
4948,Health & Beauty,5,Good quality.
4949,Health & Beauty,1,I am giving these batteries a 1 star because I couldn't go any lower. I tried 10 batteries in a row and they lasted bout 35 seconds then my light went out. The shelf life must have been ending. I guess the old addage You Get What You Paid For holds true.
4950,Health & Beauty,5,Work great and for a great price!
4951,Health & Beauty,3,Not tested so I'm not sure of quality
4952,Electronics,3,"The built quality is great taking into considerarions its price. The tablet is pretty fast and responsive. However, Amazon's operating system is horrible. I miss a lot of apps that I use in my Apple devices, and some others that just don't work as good such as Mint and Netflix (don't have download capability). Also it won't work with my Chromecast devices..."
4953,Electronics,2,I bought this thing refurbished. I find that I have to unplug / plug back in the HDMI cable on a regular basis when switching inputs on the TV. Not sure if it is the Amazon Fire box itself or if it is the TV (Not likely).Otherwise it is a good device. I bought it for the ability to hard wire my Ethernet connection to my gigabit switch and for 4K capabilities which it does do. Having the Alexa app is handy but her features can be severely handicapped.I probably should have just bought it new..... usually refurbished devices work well as they are tested before resale and it was probably tough to catch that the HDMI port on these might be finicky. I may have to switch it out.
4954,Electronics,4,For the price guy cannot beat it great for watching videos or streaming television.
4955,Health & Beauty,4,"Great price and they work- can't ask for more then that. How does Amazon do what they do- good price, great customer service, and they are very profitable. What a great business model!"
4956,Electronics,4,"This is my first android tablet. It works pretty good though don't expect it to work like an iPad. The ads are extremely annoying, but that's not Best Buy's fault."
4957,Health & Beauty,1,I used the batteries in my flameless candles 3x for about8 hours. Total bummer! They all died. Won't purchase again!Amazon should reconsider selling these turkeys Wow. Was IDisappointed. How about a replacement for these fake batterieswith real ones!
4958,Electronics,4,"Works great for my daughter, great price and apps."
4959,Health & Beauty,1,"The batteries had very short life. Long time fan of Amazon.com, first time buyer of Amazon brand batteries. Replaced batteries in a digital clock. After about 3 months (I bought the batteries in August, and now it's November), the batteries were dead. I have had this clock for years and never had any brand of batteries that lasted so short."
4960,Electronics,4,My wife like to play games and the 16g is much better and faster fo this.
4961,Health & Beauty,4,Gifted with Xmas toys.
4962,Health & Beauty,3,They really don't last very long
4963,Electronics,4,I pickup the Kindle Fire tablets for some of my clients as a gift and they love it!
4964,Electronics,4,"No technology is ever like a real book you can smell, but this little notebook in nice. It does so many things well."
4965,Electronics,4,Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
4966,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Delivered on time.
4967,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Bought this for my 90+ year-old, totally no-tech mom. Her first e-book is Gone with the Wind. She likes the size and ease of use."
4968,Electronics,4,The only problem I have is have to recharge battery every 4-5 hrs. Other than that is a great item !!
4969,Health & Beauty,2,They for really fast
4970,Health & Beauty,5,"They are batteries, half the price of the name brand sold locally and work just the same"
4971,Health & Beauty,5,I didn't know Amazon makes batteries at a very affordable amount. Now i know where to purchase batteries.
4972,Health & Beauty,1,Worst batteries ever. I use them in my remote and have to switch them every couple of weeks. Do not buy
4973,Electronics,4,"Kids love their Kindles!!! Amazon freetime allows them access to tons of age appropriate content. They love the games, apps and videos available to them based on their age. The only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the charging connectors. They are not ""kid friendly"" and the kids bent both of them upon the first time they unplugged their devices on their own. Otherwise, Kindle kids is amazing!!!"
4974,Electronics,4,Good little tablet for media. Lack of built in Google apps is annoying but can be bypassed without rooting.
4975,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for the money
4976,Electronics,3,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
4977,Health & Beauty,5,great
4978,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries last awhile.
4979,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Fought it for a long time, but Kindle is awesome. The newer version with adjustable light is best for me."
4980,Health & Beauty,4,"Good products. I like the Amazon batteries. The only reason they didn't get 4 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand. As the battery ages, it gets weaker. It lasts about as long as a normal Duracell or Energizer, but the output drops significantly as the product ages. They are great for remote controls, smoke detectors, etc. Not advisable for anything with moving parts or motors."
4981,Health & Beauty,5,Great battery pack at a great price.
4982,Health & Beauty,5,These seem to work as well as any other name brand batteries. I would buy again.
4983,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Best buy ever for my 3 year old. Only purchased because they were out of the Galaxy tablet. I'm glad. This tablet is PERFECT for my 3 year old. I love that it has 2 modes. The kids mode sometimes freeze and takes a minutes for apps to open. Also didn't download Netflix movies like indicated. But regular mode works great. My daughter loves watching weird homemade youtube movies anyway.
4984,Electronics,4,"Pros - weight is super light, small size, long battery, I fell it to floor a few times and screen didn't breakCons - it takes half second for the next page to appear on screen when turning pages, similar to ""fade in"" animation in PowerPoint. I would prefer more seemless appearance of next page."
4985,Health & Beauty,4,"WORKS FANTASTIC, EXCEED MY EXPECTATIONS, I WILL BUY IT AGAIN. GREAT PRICE, I CHECKED AND COULDN'T FIND IT CHEAPER ESPECIALLY WITH PRIME SHIPPING."
4986,Health & Beauty,4,THESE ARE VERY WELL
4987,Electronics,4,Bought this tablet after a cheaper model quit working. I found all my cloud items already available being Prime Member.
4988,Health & Beauty,5,"Good buy! So far, lasting as long as the expensive batteries."
4989,Health & Beauty,4,good price
4990,Electronics,4,"An excellent tablet for the price. Just remember that Amazon is using it to try to sell you stuff. And not all apps are available in the app store, just the ones Amazon wants you to see"
4991,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"It works great. I have three kindles right now. Best Buy is good place to buy the product, as it is guaranteed you get the lowest price."
4992,Electronics,4,I purchased as a gift for father in law and he loves it.
4993,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This is a good entry tablet for toddlers. I like the Amazon exchange policy if it breaks.
4994,Health & Beauty,3,Good price
4995,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap price and nice quality.
4996,Electronics,2,"this item is not good ok ...no use for my kids ,,,"
4997,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Probably a little too much but the device has excellent parental controls. They have used it for about a week so far with no issues.
4998,Electronics,4,Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
4999,Electronics,4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
5000,Electronics,4,"Nice tablet, great price for the product makes a good gift for someone."
5001,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent product!!! Last long, no problems."
5002,Electronics,4,"More than you average portable bluetooth speaker. Can stream from amazon, spotify, pandora, etc. As the namesake says, give it a tap to ask Alexa any questions, add to your list, order something on Amazon, etc.Battery life is good, and speaker is decent, but can't compete your UE or JBL."
5003,Electronics,4,"I like it a lot, it works well for everything I need. I would like a bigger selection of apps."
5004,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,He loves it. Helps him learn and teaches him how to count
5005,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet for myself because I bought the 8 gb one for my 6 year old and was so impressed with it that I bought myself the 16 gb one
5006,Electronics,4,This was a perfect tablet for my 12 year old. It does everything that she needed it to.
5007,Health & Beauty,1,Have tried these in various battery powered devices and they fail very quickly. I won't use them any more as I don't like having to dispose of dead batteries
5008,Electronics,4,I purchased this for my father in law and it works perfect for him. Good product for the price.
5009,Health & Beauty,2,These came with touch lights and they have been used for 7 days. The lights are already so dimmed and the batteries need replacing soon.
5010,Electronics,4,"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
5011,Health & Beauty,5,"Amazing price and with my kids, I feel like Alexa is ordering these for me once a month."
5012,Health & Beauty,5,great value. I will purchase again.
5013,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries seem to work alright, and fairly good price.Have purchased them many times now. It's amazing how many batteries you go through with all of the kids toys.I don't think these have corroded like some of the other house brands that we have bought over the years."
5014,Electronics,4,Easy access to book reader. Love watching my Netflix.Con - Slow getting on Internet.
5015,Electronics,2,"The Unit had good screen resolution and the size was not bad but, Not at all impressed with the Amazon operating system."
5016,Electronics,4,Needed an¬†inexpensive and portable Alexa device and this works perfectly.
5017,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
5018,Electronics,3,I like the size of this tablet. I have small hands and it fits. Needs to have a cover a little slippery. Easier to handle than my iPad
5019,Health & Beauty,3,I feel like we change the batteries more often with these.
5020,Electronics,4,"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
5021,Health & Beauty,1,Extremely short shelf-life and usage life would never buy Amazon batteries again
5022,Electronics,4,Good portable video /tv access.Able to view my subscription TV live shows when traveling.
5023,Electronics,3,"Great for first time tablet, but more advanced options available"
5024,Health & Beauty,4,good price.
5025,Health & Beauty,5,Work great and at a much better price than the name brands!
5026,Health & Beauty,5,They are Great
5027,Health & Beauty,5,Great pack at a great price. Nice to buy in bulk sizes and always have some on hand.
5028,Health & Beauty,5,nice batteries
5029,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,We purchased this for our 3 year grandson for Christmas and he just fell in love with it. Great learning tool to start kids off with!
5030,Electronics,4,For the price. Its great!!! I would buy another one if it goes on sale again
5031,Electronics,4,"This our first tablet so can't really compare them to all I know is we are enjoying them great for reading, games checking e-mail ."
5032,Health & Beauty,5,it is useful around the house to have spare batteries
5033,Health & Beauty,4,"good batteries for the price. great for remotes and clocks, last a little less in cameras. still a great value for the price!"
5034,Electronics,4,This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
5035,Health & Beauty,4,Excellent Value.
5036,Health & Beauty,5,The batteries are great! They work well
5037,Health & Beauty,1,These battery only last a few months in my dish network remote controls (have 10 of them). Duracells last over a yearI will no longer purchase Amazon batteries. Disappointed
5038,Health & Beauty,4,They work well I really did no comparison to other brands but the price was a great deal less .
5039,Electronics,4,Very durable for a child. Offers more than one user so everyone can read their favorite books.
5040,Electronics,4,My order came on time and great price. This item is a gift for a family member.
5041,Health & Beauty,3,I was very surprised as the batteries I got were in date but didn't work very long compared to a generic AA drug store variety. Probably just got a bad batch but I ended up replacing them very quickly in remotes especially.
5042,Health & Beauty,3,Run out of juice faster than Duracell or Energizers.
5043,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal. Great quality batteries
5044,Health & Beauty,5,works great and arrived when stated
5045,Electronics,4,"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
5046,Health & Beauty,5,They work!
5047,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,It's a good piece of technology it's just not connecting to the wifi
5048,Electronics,4,"The larger one was bought for me as part of a Christmas gift...I enjoyed mine so much that I bought this one for a birthday gift.....sturdy, stylish, padded and protects well. Good buy for the price"
5049,Electronics,3,Brought this for my 8 yr old son. He cannot put it down. Would recommend this product.
5050,Electronics,4,"I had to return my device due to WIFI signal dropping, maybe I just had a bad unit."
5051,Health & Beauty,1,The products that it was delivered but I could not find it anywhere
5052,Electronics,4,About this for my grand kids for Christmas they absolutely love it
5053,Health & Beauty,4,They seem to be lasting a while. They're batteries tho. So yeah. A convenience item for when you buy something else on here that needs batteries.
5054,Electronics,4,"As far as functionality it works well. I can surf the internet, match movies, check social media, and anything else a tablet is supposed to do. The app store has a good variety off apps. It does not have as many as the iTunes store, but there is plenty of variety. The reason I knock a star off is the constant ads. I know that this is an Amazon product, but the ads get a little annoying."
5055,Health & Beauty,5,These things really supply power!
5056,Health & Beauty,1,"I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal."
5057,Electronics,4,"Great tablet for kids. The free replacement policy is great as well. Does take a bit of effort to set up, but pretty easy for the kids to use."
5058,Electronics,4,"This was a present for my son, but he seems to be enjoying it, so it must be ok"
5059,Health & Beauty,1,you certainly get what you pay for....I bought these because the cost was about half of what I pay for name brand batteries. They last about 25 as long as the brand batteries. Hmmmm...paid half for something that lasts one quarter......My financial advisor is still wagging his finger at me
5060,Health & Beauty,5,Fit properly in the battery compartment. Powered the toy properly.
5061,Health & Beauty,5,Great Batteries. Love the performance and value. With all our remotes and other battery demands this batteries will do the trick.
5062,Electronics,2,"So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all"
5063,Electronics,4,Looking for a reader with some basic tablet functions. This was just that.
5064,Electronics,4,"I was going to have to be face down after eye surgery recently and decided to get a tablet to be able to look at the internet and movies on something other than my phone. While there are ones which have more features (and better software), the Fire HD8 had a good price and was available. It had gotten good reviews, and it performs well, with great battery life. If you're looking for a good, basic tablet, this is a nice option."
5065,Health & Beauty,5,"Arrived quickly. Easy to install with clear, simple instructions. Touch screen input seems to be the same as it was prior to installation."
5066,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to last as long as other brands.
5067,Health & Beauty,5,"You put these little cylinders in stuff and it makes them work -- flashlights, remotes, kitchen scales, clocks."
5068,Electronics,4,"The general use for this tablet is only worth for Amazon users mostly so unless your buy and use Amazon products, I don't recommend this to anyone else. The tablet is not excellent compared to others but it is fairly good for an affordable price."
5069,Health & Beauty,5,works as good as the big name batteries
5070,Electronics,4,"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
5071,Health & Beauty,1,I'm truly disappointed with these batteries
5072,Electronics,4,This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
5073,Health & Beauty,5,good value.
5074,Health & Beauty,4,Good power.
5075,Health & Beauty,5,As expected
5076,Health & Beauty,2,"I've used 10 so far, 4 in a wire less mouse and had a short life , comparing them with Maxwell batteries I used before."
5077,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, great product."
5078,Health & Beauty,5,Good.
5079,Electronics,3,I enjoy all the features on the Fire 7 tablet!!!!!
5080,Health & Beauty,5,"I buy AAA and AA batteries about 4 - 6 times a year. I made the switch to Amazon batteries about 2 years ago and never looked back. These batteries work just as well as any of the name brands, but at a much more reasonable cost."
5081,Health & Beauty,1,I opened up this package fresh and put two AA batteries in my Xbox one controller. It only lasted for a few hours of gameplay. When I took the batteries out they seem quite warm. I used my heat gun and they were 115F. I got a new set of two batteries and placed it in my controller. They only kept the controller on for less than a minute. When I took the batteries out one burned my finger. I grabbed my heat temperature gun and in certain spots it registered over 127I'm not going to try and use anymore in any electronics. I'm not sure what's going on here Amazon.
5082,Electronics,4,"I exchanged the paper white that I had bought for this Voyage. This is thinner, lighter and just easier to hold than the paperwhite. Still getting used to the archive system since I had a Nook before, bit of a learning curve. But I like the Kindle interface better than the Nook, the book suggestions and shopping for books is much better. The only thing I miss is that the Kindle doesn't tell you what % battery you have left, it just shows you the bar in the battery symbol."
5083,Electronics,4,Got this tablet for my 7yr old daughter and it has been great for her. It's the right size for her little hands. Only drawback is the you can not get google apps on it. Apps have to be from Amazon and they might not have the app you want.
5084,Health & Beauty,5,"If you, like me, dont care what batteries you use in your TV remote these are fine for youPros-Um 100 batteriesThey come in packs of 4, so not loose batteries rolling aroundCons-I hear they may drain quicker than more expensive batteries. To that I say: I have 99 more where that came from."
5085,Health & Beauty,5,Great price fast shipping
5086,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries can be expensive! However, Amazon has taken the opportunity to sell a good quality product. There are plenty of batteries for the cost, and in these times of uncertainty we need to be prepared for our family. During times of power outage batteries are so comforting because they allow us to maintain a sense comfort. They also sell these in triple a, c, and d. The price is good compared to other brands, and the quality of Amazon is backing the product. Safe and good buy for any consumer."
5087,Health & Beauty,3,fine
5088,Electronics,1,"did not power up...at all. I am so happy that my grand-niece wasn't here and doesn't know about this yet, she would have been crying."
5089,Health & Beauty,5,Work great.
5090,Electronics,3,I have a Paper White 1 and 2. Honestly it is difficult to justify double the price value. I certainly like most added features but not sure its worth the extra money. To note it operates great just not sure its worth an upgrade to the latest greatest.
5091,Electronics,4,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
5092,Electronics,4,I love that I can limit access and the amount of time my daughter uses this tablet. I also love that she has her own profile that she can make her own so she feels like it's just for her and not for the both of us.
5093,Electronics,4,This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
5094,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Good tablet for young kids. Battery life could be better
5095,Electronics,1,We are unable to connect WIFI on this product. We have tried to follow the instructions to no avail. It is a useless and expensive item sitting on our table.
5096,Electronics,4,I liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor... Not too big and bulky compared to others.
5097,Health & Beauty,1,I put two of these in my small flashlight and they only lasted about 15 minutes. Waste of money.
5098,Health & Beauty,5,Arrived on time. Long lasting batteries.
5099,Electronics,4,Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
5100,Health & Beauty,5,"Working great, can't beat Prime 2 day shipping."
5101,Electronics,4,This tablet works great but the only down fall is often times it slows down. Other than that great tablet for children at a good price.
5102,Electronics,1,"Returned within a week, did not like it. I didn't care for the ads every time I turned the tablet on."
5103,Health & Beauty,3,Totally not convinced these are as good as name brands because I have had to replace several batteries way too soon.
5104,Health & Beauty,5,They last just as long as the bunny rabbit battery
5105,Health & Beauty,4,"Pleased with the expiration dates, these are a good trade off, of cost and quality"
5106,Health & Beauty,5,Thank you Amazon for providing everything I think I need!
5107,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries work but don't really last that long. You maybe get 3-4 weeks out of them. Its better off buying rayovac or energizer batteries from home depot
5108,Health & Beauty,1,not good at all
5109,Health & Beauty,3,nothing bad to say but I can get others for cheaper price.
5110,Electronics,4,"I bought this tablet for my son so he could have something to entertain him on our road trips. It works great. I love the child-proof case that it comes with. My only complaint is that the interface is slow sometimes. I'm honestly not surprised though, because it runs off of Android. I typically avoid Android but I figured I would give it a shot. After using this tablet, I think I will avoid using Android products again. Besides the slowness of the Android OS, it is still a great tablet."
5111,Health & Beauty,5,"Ever since getting an insulin pump, I've been using more AAA batteries since my pump uses them. I was happy to find that AmazonBasics offers AAA batteries at a bargain price so that I don't have to spend more money keeping myself alive. Type 1 diabetes is expensive in itself and I'm glad that I can save, even if it's just spare change, on the products I need to purchase to keep my insulin pump going. I find that these last just as long as name-brand batteries and have had no problems with them. In the future I will be using Amazon's Subscribe Save program now that I know how long the batteries in my insulin pump last. Overall, I would recommend these batteries if you regularly use AAA batteries and like to save money."
5112,Health & Beauty,4,good
5113,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my 7 year old, it has endured all that a 7 year old would and could give it."
5114,Health & Beauty,5,"Just as good as the similar-looking brand name batteries, but are a fraction of the cost."
5115,Health & Beauty,5,Great price.
5116,Electronics,3,"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
5117,Health & Beauty,5,Works as well as the name brand batteries but so much cheaper! Easy to unpack also.
5118,Electronics,4,Purchase it for my granddaughter and she love it many great children's app for learning
5119,Health & Beauty,4,decent batteries. doesnt seem to last as long as better brands. use it for xbox 1 controller.
5120,Electronics,4,This product was easy to set up and to use. Works great and has expandable storage which is nice.
5121,Health & Beauty,3,Not all that long life.
5122,Electronics,4,"Purchased on Black FridayPros - Great Price (even off sale)Very powerful and fast with quad core processors Amazing soundWell builtCons -Amazon ads, Amazon need this to subsidize the tablet and will remove the adds if you pay them $15.Inability to access other apps except the ones from Amazon. There is a way which I was able to accomplish to add the Google Play storeNet this is a great tablet for the money"
5123,Electronics,4,I like the unit but battery seems to run down more quickly that my previous Fire. Also gets warm while charging.
5124,Electronics,3,Decent somewhat slow. Netflix freezes up at times.
5125,Electronics,4,Good deal and a great price. Wish the Geek Squad knew more about combining kindle accounts
5126,Health & Beauty,4,not bad for price
5127,Health & Beauty,5,Works great.
5128,Health & Beauty,5,when we put them in the appliance they worked properly.
5129,Electronics,4,Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
5130,Health & Beauty,4,"I have switched to AmazonBasics brand after trying just about every brand there is. Good, reliable batteries."
5131,Electronics,4,"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
5132,Health & Beauty,5,They are good like any other batteries and the price is good.
5133,Electronics,4,The tablet is great for young children. They really enjoy. It can be slow at times and they get frustrated when that happens.
5134,Health & Beauty,5,"I've been buying AAA alkaline batteries in packages of four at the dollar store and thought I was getting a pretty good deal on the price, but it bothered me to have to throw away so much packaging every time I needed four batteries. Then I was checking out a fellow reviewer's profile and found a review of the AmazonBasics AAA batteries. He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging. Amazon claims 10-year, no-leak shelf life for them, but even I use batteries faster than that.I think this is a great product at a great price and I love the packaging. Glad I stumbled onto them."
5135,Health & Beauty,4,Only batteries I use now...
5136,Health & Beauty,5,They were just what we expected and needed.
5137,Electronics,4,We got this mostly to read books and play some games it's a cheap tablet so no problem if it gets broken don't buy the extended warranty not worthy.
5138,Health & Beauty,1,I don't know if I would buy thus brand again seems like they don't last as long as Duracell
5139,Health & Beauty,4,Long lasting life
5140,Health & Beauty,5,Just as good as Energizer
5141,Electronics,4,Great for what it is. The product is solid. Got it as a gift for family.
5142,Health & Beauty,5,"They're normal batteries, I just love that I could order them online and have them shipped with the wireless mouse I ordered the same day and have them arrive at the same time!"
5143,Health & Beauty,5,Amazon rocks. Great batteries at the click of a button lol!
5144,Health & Beauty,4,Nice and cheap last just as long as the expensive ones that claim they last twice as long than the others. Had a few duds from the others and these so no big complaints.
5145,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal on here! A+ rating for battery life!
5146,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
5147,Health & Beauty,5,good price
5148,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent value for the money.
5149,Health & Beauty,3,"The price was good, but we had some trouble with them working in a flashlight. They didn't connect right, and we couldn't get it to work. The flashlight worked with other batteries, though."
5150,Electronics,3,"It's a little slow, and the camera isn't the best, but for the price it's fine"
5151,Health & Beauty,5,Excelent
5152,Electronics,4,I was very pleased with how easy it is for children to maneuver.
5153,Health & Beauty,5,For this price I cant believe how many I get! And they last forever!!
5154,Electronics,4,Replacement tablet for my 6 yr old after she accidentally shattered the screen. We have been VERY happy with our kindle tablets
5155,Health & Beauty,5,great price for so many batteries good quality
5156,Health & Beauty,5,Great price. Work great.
5157,Health & Beauty,5,Always work great.
5158,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks
5159,Electronics,2,I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
5160,Electronics,4,"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
5161,Electronics,4,This is my second amazon fire purchase. I wanted one for home and one to keep with me for traveling and work. It's was to negotiate and fits all my basic daily needs.
5162,Electronics,4,Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
5163,Health & Beauty,5,GOOD BATTERY AT A GOOD PRICE
5164,Health & Beauty,5,Great Deal
5165,Electronics,4,"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
5166,Health & Beauty,5,Its a quality battery
5167,Electronics,4,I bought this for my daughter. I like it all in all. I was unaware that it didn't have a google to do internet searching.
5168,Health & Beauty,5,Not bad for the price.
5169,Electronics,4,good little tablet. I use it for entertainment. no issues hooking it up to my network.
5170,Health & Beauty,5,as adv
5171,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries work great, no issues. I will be buying again when I run low."
5172,Health & Beauty,1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
5173,Health & Beauty,1,"As soon as i place the new battery in my card alarm, ut says 1 bar charged"
5174,Electronics,3,Great case.. took awhile to get to my house but after several delays it finally got there.
5175,Electronics,4,Got this product for a relative for christmas who had a kindle fire and was looking for an upgrade. With how far technology has grown on phones she was only looking for a reader and something that was lighter on her thumbs when reading then her kindle fire. This product was not only lighter on her thumbs but also worked great in any light.
5176,Electronics,3,Right after we bought it the charging port broke but it was very easy to get the tablet replaced and shipped to our house. It's not very operations friendly and comes with very little instruction.
5177,"Electronics,Media",4,"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun. For a product of this price, it shouldn't be missing any features. Otherwise it is great, light, and the text refreshes quickly and is crisp."
5178,Electronics,4,BOUGHT FOR 3 YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER. SHE LOVES IT AND NOW SHE WON'T NEED TO STEAL MOMS TABLET OR PHONE.
5179,Electronics,4,i really enjoy this tablet made a great christmas gift
5180,Electronics,4,Good product for listening to and reading books. Also works well when u don't want to carry an expensive and heavy laptop.
5181,Health & Beauty,4,great price
5182,Health & Beauty,5,EXCELLENT
5183,Electronics,4,"My old Kindle was not working so good anymore so bought this one on a Black Friday Deal from Best Buy. Price was great. The only problem I had was that at times it did not seem to be charging well or fast. I took it back to Best Buy and they would have replaced it for me but then would have lost all progress in games I had played. The person at Tech Support suggested that I change the plug in ""brick"". He said that they have had problems with that. I can use the same plug that I use for my iphone and now it charges fine. Glad that it was an easy fix."
5184,Health & Beauty,5,As promised
5185,Health & Beauty,4,works as stated on product
5186,Health & Beauty,2,This does not last for more than two months on my LG Magic remote.A basic remote truck lasts only for four days.
5187,Electronics,4,It's nice and portable and works well on the go. Wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button.
5188,Electronics,4,"works great, easy to use. play videos and game good"
5189,Health & Beauty,5,What can I say - they power the remotes
5190,Health & Beauty,5,Works better than the big name brands
5191,Health & Beauty,5,"Bulk batteries, what more is there to say."
5192,Health & Beauty,5,"I was sick and tired of my duracells leaking so I bought these. Only one month in, so it's hard to know if they leak, but so far so good. No complaints."
5193,Electronics,1,I had to return this product as it was not compatible with things such as Facebook and Itunes... which is what I needed it for. Great if you are into books and streaming movies!
5194,Electronics,4,"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
5195,Health & Beauty,5,Great!
5196,Health & Beauty,4,"Some of the batteries were already dead, but not all of them."
5197,Health & Beauty,5,As described
5198,Electronics,4,"I've had my Fire HD 8 2015 for about a year and have been very satisfied with it. My wife has been using an older Fire 7 (non-HD) and I thought it was time for an upgrade for her so I decided to buy her this new Fire HD 8 for Christmas. I also installed a sceen protector, a new case and a 64GB SD card before wrapping it.She was very surprised and pleased and she noticed the big difference in speed, sound and picture quality immediately. I'm very happy she likes it so much. Thanks Amazon for the great product and Best Buy for the great price."
5199,Health & Beauty,4,good deal
5200,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and product!
5201,Electronics,3,"The amazon tablet is priced amazingly. However, the tablet needs to be restarted constantly to find a WiFi connection."
5202,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT PRICE GOOD PRODUCT WORKS GREAT
5203,Health & Beauty,4,"Good value, never had one leak or go bad. Keep them in the refrigerator for longest life."
5204,Health & Beauty,5,Love it.
5205,Electronics,4,Got this for the kids for Xmas...was the BEST gift.
5206,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
5207,Health & Beauty,1,Stopped working in less than 3 months.
5208,Electronics,4,Purchased 2 of these and am real satisfied with them!!
5209,Electronics,4,The table is great just to experience what is available on a tablet without a hugh expense. I would recommend to others.
5210,Health & Beauty,4,OK
5211,Health & Beauty,3,TV Clicker about 2 months
5212,Electronics,4,"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
5213,Health & Beauty,1,Doesn't last as advertised. Dead in no time!
5214,Health & Beauty,1,You get what you pay for. They do not last very long at all. It's better to buy Duracell.
5215,Electronics,4,A little more space on outer edges would be great. I only use it for gaming and have had 1 real problem. At times it kicks me out of the game (popular game from EW) Otherwise great for what I do. Needs more security. But overall good purchase for less than 100$.
5216,Electronics,4,It is a lot cheaper than other tablets with all the functions I need.
5217,Electronics,4,"I really love this tablet for my toddler! The only things I have against it are that there is no kickstand on it, it may lag at times, and there is no way to lock the screen so the movie can't be exited. Other than that it's a great tablet."
5218,Electronics,4,My daughter said she really like her table. She can do her homework and school work on it. Also she do other things on it to.
5219,Electronics,4,Great tablet for toddlers. Been using it the last week. Put it on the front carseat headrest to keep them distracted while on the road.
5220,Electronics,4,"Great Product, User Friendly and can't be beaten for the promotion prices."
5221,Health & Beauty,5,thanks juju
5222,Electronics,4,Perfect starter item for kids learning electronics.
5223,Electronics,4,"I have the kindle tablet but the 8gb, I needed more memory so.i upgraded."
5224,Electronics,4,This was a good pick for first kids tablets. I just wish getting to their apps was a little easier
5225,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I like it my son can watch his 2 favorite shows with out any problems
5226,Health & Beauty,4,Long lasting life
5227,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent purchase, especially for the price. 2 toddlers in the house make batteries a commodity item. There are excellent reviews that compare AmazonBasics to the usual battery brands. I highly suggest you read them to see that there really isn't a difference and since the price is so much lower these are a no brainer."
5228,Health & Beauty,4,don't last that long but ok
5229,Electronics,3,Easy to setup. Large screen. Protective case built-in. Two year protection plan included.
5230,Electronics,4,Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
5231,Health & Beauty,5,I love Amazon batteries. Awesome value and comparable to the top brands.
5232,Electronics,4,i mainly purchased this so my child can have access to amazon undergrond to get free apps. he normally uses an ipad . i can tell this is slower but i was not looking for ipad quality. it gets the job done
5233,Health & Beauty,4,"There was a deal somewhere where I could get 48 AA batteries, I wish I could get that deal for these batteries."
5234,Health & Beauty,3,all Satisfactory
5235,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries seem to work like Energizers, but at a great deal"
5236,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"Easy to figure out and I like the paperwhite because it doesn‚Äôt strain your eyes and you can adjust the size of the font. Bought one for my mom too and she loves it. The only con is the touch sensitivity could be better, but not bad for $60 on sale"
5237,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries.
5238,Health & Beauty,5,good price
5239,Electronics,4,"The Kindle Voyage is the best e-reader experience available. Text is super-sharp, it's comfortable to hold, the built-in self-adjusting light is awesome, and you change the page by either swiping with your finger or pushing down on the bezel. Unfortunately, all those great features come at a $199 price that is $80 more than Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite and more than double the cost of the company's entry level reader, both of which are excellent in their own right. So five stars for the device itself and minus one star for the high price."
5240,Electronics,4,I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
5241,Electronics,4,Bought for my kids and they love them!! They love the camera!
5242,Electronics,4,"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
5243,Health & Beauty,4,Works great and holds chaege as well as and battery I have had
5244,Electronics,4,So far the tablet has been working without any issues. Haven't used it enough to rate it any higher but time will tell.
5245,Health & Beauty,5,Works just as well as name brands if not better.
5246,Electronics,4,My grandson really enjoys his new Kindle that he for for a Christmas present.
5247,Electronics,3,A few problems with games loading but over all good
5248,Health & Beauty,1,"Worst batteries I have ever purchased - bought them for Christmas items like battery operated lights and candles but they didn't last even a week with limited usage. Spend a little more and get more for your and time, it'll save you in the long run!"
5249,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good. I haven't noticed them dying fast so they are much better than your off brand cheap knock off ones. We shall see how long they last.
5250,Health & Beauty,5,works great!
5251,Health & Beauty,5,Item as described
5252,Electronics,3,"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
5253,Health & Beauty,5,LOVE these! They last a long time and you can't beat the price! Great value!
5254,Health & Beauty,5,can't get a better value.
5255,Health & Beauty,3,doesn't last as long as say duracel.
5256,Health & Beauty,5,"I looked at the average rating of the major battery brands (EverReady, Duracell, Rayovac , etc). they all rate the same as these. Same complaints from the one and two star raters. I conclude batteries are batteries. So, I bought these and I've been happy with them."
5257,Electronics,4,"Easy, friendly features that allows for uncomplicated use and function."
5258,Health & Beauty,5,"of course these are no energizer bunny batteries, but for the price and amount you get, you cant beat it! They come in individual packs of 4, inside a white box to keep them in. I would recommend it"
5259,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my mom while she was in rehab following shoulder surgery. She loved it. I put several books on it for her and she liked the ease of use, she does not get on the computer and so I needed it to be easy."
5260,Health & Beauty,1,I got a bad batch. 4 of them arrived dead. I would have sent them back but I missed my window.
5261,"Electronics,Media",4,"This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt."
5262,Health & Beauty,4,These work great for the price.
5263,Electronics,4,Nothing further to Comment. Giving as a Xmas gift.
5264,Health & Beauty,3,"Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store"
5265,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for young children. Our kids got them for Christmas so we are still trying to figure everything out. I would recommend buying an sd card with your purchase of the tablet bc storage space runs out fast.
5266,Health & Beauty,5,batteries work great for my xbox controller. I get the same amount of time as any other brand I have bought.
5267,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
5268,Electronics,2,"After owning the kids Samsung, this seems confusing to navigate. Also they have returned to using the Samaumg"
5269,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries! who knew amazon could hit ALL of the basics!!
5270,Health & Beauty,4,The package just arrived and all seems well. I have no information on the life of these batteries. If they do well I would be glad to give them 5 stars.
5271,Health & Beauty,5,"Excellent value, still going strong in all the items I've used them in so far."
5272,Health & Beauty,4,"pretty good life span, but not fantastic"
5273,Health & Beauty,5,great price on batteries
5274,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"Works fine on wifi, otherwise a little slow. My kid enjoys it though. For the price it's good."
5275,Electronics,4,"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
5276,Electronics,4,We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
5277,Health & Beauty,1,Pretty sure they didn't really have a charge when they arrived
5278,Health & Beauty,4,works so far
5279,Electronics,4,"Received the Amazon Fire HD8 and it works well, BUT it is clogged up with constant ads. I had to contact Amazon to turn them off, at an additional cost of $15+tax.. When promoting this item at this price, it should have a notice that the price is discounted by the inclusion of constant ads!"
5280,Electronics,4,"I bought this tablet for my 3rd grader, she loves it! She will be on it for hours at a time, there's a feature that allows me to put time limits which I love. Reason I gave it 4 stars is because sometimes the filtered content doesn't have a lot of options. However, I would buy again."
5281,Health & Beauty,5,good price
5282,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,We found there to be too many pop up ads and returned it.
5283,Electronics,4,My kids love them. Able to do so many things with it!
5284,Health & Beauty,5,good price
5285,Electronics,4,"Was lookin get for a tablet to use as an inexpensive second. This one has worked well for me and my needs. Use it when out at the coffee shop and take it in stores when needing to look up information on items. For the price, works very well."
5286,Health & Beauty,5,fine
5287,Health & Beauty,5,Price was right........quality is good
5288,Electronics,4,"I like this e reader, but wish the screen were higher resolution. It requires decent light to look good, but it is easy on my eyes. The screen updates involve flashing the whole screen, which I noticed less over time. The advertised month long battery life is just standby time, it lasts much less if you are downloading and reading books."
5289,Electronics,4,"it works well, my only real gripe is that you're limited to the Amazon store for apps and some apps aren't the real provider, but a 3rd party app that is...hokey. Other than that for $50 I can't complain."
5290,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries. Work very well
5291,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This Table is good for children because won't break if dropped. However, the only problem I have, as well as other people in the family who bought the same Table, is the charger port that get damaged after first few days of use."
5292,Health & Beauty,2,Breaks down too fast and won't run my trail camera but around 6 hours.
5293,Health & Beauty,4,great deal---
5294,Health & Beauty,5,"Lieutenant Dan got me these batteries. So then I got a call from him, saying we dont have to worry about batteries no more. And I said, thats good! One less thing. -Forrest"
5295,Electronics,4,"I know many people who have a kindle. It frees up using the cell phone memory, so I bought this one for the amount of storage it has, as well as the cost of the item. Thank you."
5296,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
5297,Electronics,2,"Downloaded movies for my son to watch and the audio is terrible, you could barely hear it so I returned it"
5298,Health & Beauty,4,"These are hard to beat when it comes to price, but I have found that they do not last as long as Energizer or Duracell. They come close, I think, but definitely not as long. I use AA batteries primarily in my iMac bluetooth keyboard and mouse, for what it's worth. Still, these amazon batteries are significantly cheaper, so it all probably evens out."
5299,Health & Beauty,4,Seems to be equal to any other brand of batteries I have used.
5300,Electronics,3,good product but very hard to customize like real androids. Can not install firefox or other SW that Amazon deems a competition...too bad
5301,Health & Beauty,4,Worked as expected.
5302,Health & Beauty,4,They are batteries and they work. I don't think they last as long as some of the more expensive batteries but really its hard to tell.
5303,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are bad. In any device the last only a very short time.
5304,Electronics,4,If you are a Prime member its a good little speaker to have. Need WIFI or Hotspot.
5305,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"I love these Tablets, but the charging ports aren't the best. I bought 3 for Christmas and my kids take excellent care of them. I also do NOT them touch the tablets while they are charging. They have only had their tablets since Christmas day and they won't charge. I highly recommend getting the protection warranty for this item."
5306,Health & Beauty,5,what a good deal on batteries they work well
5307,Health & Beauty,2,Don't suite my purpose.
5308,Health & Beauty,5,Great product - as described.
5309,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great tablet. Great performance and is stable. I have ipads and other tablets and I really enjoy reading and watching shows on my kindle fire vs any other tabletThe kid version is kind of annoying. So.many. apps.. ugh. And kids dont understand that they have to wait longer if they're going to download 100 apps at one time..
5310,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries + Amazon Awesome
5311,Health & Beauty,4,great
5312,Health & Beauty,1,"I like amazon products. But these haven't worked in any thing I've put them in. Nerf gun, toys.. nothing. Maybe they work in remotes....."
5313,Electronics,4,I bought this tablet to replace my textbook. It has everything I want and need. I only purchased it after I learned you can download from google play. The amazon equivalent to google play has a lot of the same apps and games.
5314,Electronics,3,"This device fulfill a daily needs. You can use for a very basic thing like browsing, listening the music, watching movie or reading. The quality of the picture and the sound is not too bad. If you are a vet picky person.. this device will not work for you. The only cons for me is that this device can't connect to Tv."
5315,Health & Beauty,3,"...not even in a mouse, where I've already had to replace the batteries in less than three months, where premium brand batteries last the best part of a year or more.I thought these would be a bargain given the price. But the life is so short there is no benefit or savings. I won't buy these again."
5316,Electronics,4,"Purchased this for my 83 year old mother to primarily use as an e-reader. It seems as this may be easier for her to see than an actual book. She does not always find new technology easy to use, but seems to be doing ok with this tablet. She also is using it to play solitaire and possibly some other games."
5317,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price for batteries, I never buy them in stores anymore"
5318,Electronics,4,Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
5319,Health & Beauty,2,"I was disappointed with these batteries. I thought they were going to be a higher quality and work as well as the name brand batteries. I bought these to use in my sons' leapster GS explorers. My sons do not play on them nonstop and they shut off on their own after being idle for a few minutes. These batteries don't even last 3 days. 8 hrs of use at the most! Because we can't afford to go through batteries so quickly, I change them once a week. It's really sad that they don't hold up longer. Time to go back to brand name as it will save money over these and use some rechargables. Do not buy if you plan on using these for something more than a remote or clock."
5320,Electronics,4,This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
5321,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries for super price! I am on recurring shipment - get a box once a month.
5322,Health & Beauty,5,They were a gift.
5323,Health & Beauty,4,Seems decent as far as life of the batteries. Good enough to stock up on these for emergencies.
5324,Health & Beauty,1,These r the worst batteries ever! Amazon should stop selling!!! They last a couple of weeks on a clock! Everyone I've used! I should send back..
5325,Electronics,4,"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
5326,Health & Beauty,5,"Work great, just what I needed."
5327,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality for an affordable price.
5328,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries kick ass. Just as good as name brand. Would purchase again!
5329,Electronics,4,Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
5330,Health & Beauty,5,"Works as well as the Big brands, well worth the money"
5331,Health & Beauty,2,"These batteries are HYPED! Duracell always wins. I bought them for electronic circuit for my experiments and I can clearly see how they fail against Duracell AAA batteries. I also wonder about the review someone has put that shows the performance plots. Under standard conditions doesn't matter, batteries need to perform the way consumers use them. To be fair, these batteries are better but don't show them as the best in the world, no way!"
5332,Health & Beauty,2,Stay away from this brand. Doesn't last long.
5333,Electronics,4,"This is a great entry level tablet. It does not have all of the bells and whistles of more expensive tablets, however, at its price point the specs are quite impressive. This is an easy purchase for a small sized tablet or for a child. It is powerful enough and the screen quality is good enough. Overall, I highly recommend it."
5334,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Nice and convenient just wish that it came with written directions so that I could brighten up the screen.
5335,Electronics,4,"I mean, you can't argue with the price of this, but it's lacking some big name apps that I thought would have Amazon Fire versions but don't. Like Dropbox or BBC News or LA Times. Screen is great. Battery seems to last a long time. And the size is better than iPad if you're using it for reading mostly, you can hold it in one hand. I'd recommend... but with caution that you're going to be missing some useful apps."
5336,Electronics,4,Was looking for something small I could use to get on the Internet and check emails and this is prefect for that
5337,Electronics,4,I've started to allow this device to grow on me. Yes I saw some color variation but either my eyes have adjusted or it's gone away. I'm back to reading like I used to and love it!
5338,Health & Beauty,5,Nice battery
5339,Electronics,4,"Good sound but unlike Echo, you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do. I ordered a Dot so this may solve that issue."
5340,Health & Beauty,5,A+
5341,Health & Beauty,5,Very quality
5342,Health & Beauty,2,"Somewhat disappointed with these batteries. They die rather quickly. I'm not using them for things that use a lot of power either. Like the remote for my TV. I have to change them frequently. Expiration date of 2026, but they go fast, unless I got a bad batch. I would rate them down there with cheap Rav-o-vac or a grocery store brand."
5343,Electronics,4,The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
5344,Electronics,3,"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
5345,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Have not used the product. This item was a gift and I have not yet received word on the product.
5346,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product, long lasting with a great price."
5347,Health & Beauty,5,Great amount of batteries for the price of them.
5348,Health & Beauty,5,great for the teens.
5349,Health & Beauty,4,Bout to go with an rc truck. Seems to be holding power as good as Energizer
5350,Electronics,4,"Hard to use, No way to delete things from screen. Need better manual. most books are impossible if they are reference books."
5351,Electronics,4,Amazon Fire tablets are great for the non-technical user. 90% of people can use them however they are locked down to the Amazon ecosystem which prevents you from easily using applications in the Android Google Play store.
5352,Health & Beauty,2,They did last that long.
5353,Health & Beauty,4,"Price is right, but doesn't seem to hold as long of a charge as some of the other name brand batteries."
5354,Health & Beauty,5,"This battery pack is economical, and the convenience of having it delivered is a plus."
5355,Health & Beauty,1,I bought the 20 pack in September 2015. Half of the batteries in the package do not work. Do not purchase.
5356,Health & Beauty,5,This is the best iPad cover ...you can't beat it
5357,Health & Beauty,1,"These are cheap batteries. To make matters worse, Amazon sends old DEAD batteries mixed in with newer ones and ship them off to you. At least half of our last (and final) package had dead batteries and worked for maybe a day. Amazon wouldn't return our money for them. WASTE OF TIME."
5358,Health & Beauty,2,These batteries do not have a long life.
5359,"Electronics,Media",4,"Enjoy my summer reading and a regular tablet just will not do. Initially disappointed by the small size, but I quickly learned to appreciate it. Very portable and convenient. I wanted something easy on the eyes with a 3G connection so I did not have to be connected to WIFI to download books. Was a bit more then I wanted to pay but feel I will get good use out of it."
5360,Health & Beauty,5,Always happy with these batteries. Cost effective. Last a long time.
5361,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"I'd suggest 8-12 is a good age for this tablet, it's a great starter tablet until your young one shows responsibility, care and proper use of electronics."
5362,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and solid performer!
5363,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work as well as name brand batteries at a much better price
5364,Electronics,4,"This is a very solid device for under $100. The screen quality is great, and performance is hard to beat for most typical use. I needed more power to run some very intense apps, like Litchi for controlling a DJI Mavic. So if you are looking for a Powerhouse you should look for something with a bit more processor and atleast 3Gb Ram."
5365,Health & Beauty,4,Ok
5366,Electronics,2,"nice size, very clear but randomly shuts off. cant remove unwanted apps from the home screen. if you watch video..it buffers alot and laggs."
5367,Health & Beauty,5,"Great buy for the money - these batteries work very well. I've gotten them in the past. The best part is that they are so inexpensive that you can run through them, and not feel like you're running through your bank account!"
5368,Health & Beauty,5,Amazing Deal
5369,Health & Beauty,5,Suits my needs.
5370,Electronics,4,I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
5371,Health & Beauty,4,good
5372,Electronics,4,I purchased these tablets for my twin boys knowing they are extremely rough the 2 year warranty was a definite plus. i purchased these in February/March I believe and have had 1 replaced. Not due to physical damage but the screen turned white on the center on 1 of them. The only issue I have is when we are not connected to wifi they are only able to access limited items such a puzzles and a few apps. i also noticed that some of them require licensing updates. Which are inconvenient only because it seems to happen when we are not near wifi. Other than that i love them and my boys love them.
5373,Health & Beauty,1,These last about 5 hrs in a roku remote using the headphones. Really disappointed in how long they last.
5374,Electronics,4,Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
5375,Electronics,4,I purchased this tablet and am very happy with it.
5376,Electronics,4,"My kid love this tablet!! The setup was so easy, and the amazon store has a bunch of educational apps! That my kid can enjoy playing and learning!!"
5377,Health & Beauty,5,"YES. Finally a battery that doesn't cost my immortal soul. But seriously, cheap batteries that last forever."
5378,Electronics,4,Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
5379,Electronics,3,Amazon Tap.. got it on Black Friday sale.. But so far feel not as easy as I think to use.. But if you just use as Bluetooth speaker and sound is good.. Maybe just have to learn how to use it more..
5380,Health & Beauty,2,Half the batteries didn't work!
5381,Electronics,4,the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
5382,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries. They work as they should. They should last 5 years: hopefully so.
5383,Health & Beauty,4,Ok.
5384,Electronics,4,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
5385,Electronics,4,Very happy with my new tablet. Everything is assessible and easy to find. Great pic quality. My 10 year old loves it and has taken ownership of it which shows how easy it is to use.
5386,Health & Beauty,4,Good buy and good quality. Last as long the copper top and you get twice the quantity.
5387,Health & Beauty,3,"At first we were completely happy with the Amazon Basics line of batteries. Reasonably priced and what we thought was good quality. Well, after a couple months of use in one of our daughters toys, two out of the three batteries that were in the device burst. This is nothing I have experienced with Duracell or Energizer. Will be switching back to Duracell Procell."
5388,Electronics,4,I chose this product from my daughter's this is a great product keeps them from fighting and misbehaving. I think everyone should have one for their child this is a great product to help them learn and really affordable the people at Best Buy were really helpful.
5389,Electronics,4,"I got this little tablet to carry around with me because it fits in my purse. I like it for what I got it to do - have something to read all the time, but it's REALLY slow. So if you're impatient and don't want to wait for apps to load, don't get this!"
5390,Health & Beauty,5,"Good price, Easier to order them on here than to remember to buy them at the store."
5391,Electronics,2,"I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one. This thing may go back to the store as soon as tonight."
5392,Electronics,4,"It's 85% as good as an Echo... Great sound, nice and loud, but... But the button. That button!!I would give this 5 stars and buy more of them, IF it was always listening while plugged in. Other than that, it does everything an Echo does, it's smaller, and (due to the battery) portable. I like it - I do. But it's not as useful as the Echo in the situation I use it the most."
5393,Electronics,4,Got this at a great price as a second tablet. The battery life is so good that I use when traveling for movie watching. Great screen and quick response times.
5394,Electronics,4,"I bought 2 of these. I didn't want to pay the price for an iPad since they were a gift for my pre-teens. Very satisfied with my purchase and the kids were able to get their gaming apps. Con: they take a while to charge, that's why I'm giving it 4 stars."
5395,Electronics,4,Good for reading white and blackScreen is still small
5396,Electronics,4,Really good tablet. Very nice picture. Really easy to use.
5397,Electronics,4,We already had a tablet for our son and it was time to get one for our daughter. They are a good learning tool.
5398,Health & Beauty,2,"These batteries seemed to die very quickly. We used them for xbox one and wii controllers and while I wasn't the only person to use them, nor was I always around when they were being used to gauge the amount of their use, I seemed to have to replace batteries weekly."
5399,Health & Beauty,5,"I've stopped buying regular batteries (AA, AAA, etc...) anywhere but Amazon.For the price, these are unbeatable for standard alkaline batteries.Especially with toddler toys....batteries come and go, fast."
5400,Health & Beauty,1,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but I'm getting less than two week's of use when I use them in my Baldwin Keyless Deadbolt (https://www.amazon.com/Baldwin-8252-AC1-Cylinder-Electronic-Deadbolt/dp/B00441UCY0/) which takes 4 AA batteries. The Duracell Alkaline usually last 2-3 months, so I'm pretty appalled at how short these. I'm in San Francisco and it doesn't get that cold so I don't think that's the problem.I've tested the batteries with my tester (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005G7SBY4) and it indicates they are good and in the green, yet won't drive the deadbolt.When I took the weakened batteries out of the deadbolt (that still show green) and put them in my headlamp (https://www.amazon.com/Fenix-HL23-Headlamp-XP-G2-FENIX-HL23-XP-G2-GOLD/dp/B00SH08UXY/), they only give about 20 minutes before they completely die."
5401,Health & Beauty,5,As if Amazon had to be any better at anything else. These batteries are great. I was skeptical but you can't beat the price and they last a long time. Must have if you have kids and their toys that require a lot of batteries.
5402,Health & Beauty,5,"Good Deal, quick shipping"
5403,Health & Beauty,5,Good
5404,Health & Beauty,5,"Like most people I use tons of batteries. The super high price and hassle of the marketing and nomenclature of buying them at the store is removed by buying these Amazon battery packs. More and more I am realizing that when possible it's a good idea to go with the 'Amazon Basics' products (especially for items like batteries). Certainly there are premium batteries that I have trusted for years and will continue to purchase. But I have found no difference between these Amazon batteries and my favorite other brands. So instead of buying 2 or 5 packs of batteries while waiting to check out in the store think about getting a realistic quantity of excellent batteries for half the price (maybe not half, but certainly less than name brands)."
5405,Electronics,4,"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
5406,Health & Beauty,5,Ok
5407,Health & Beauty,5,"Tried these for the first time last night. Played indoor with my wife and 12 and 6 year old daughters. Awesome time! Beats sitting around the table playing a board game. I will check back in the Spring to see if they are still working. So far, I highly recommend."
5408,Electronics,4,"Speakers has an excellent quality, despite the small size.The only disadvantage is the Amazon Echo feature, not present in this one, which you can just ""call"" Alexa and she will answer you. In this one, as the name says, you need to ""tap"" the button to wake Alexa up."
5409,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are actually falling apart before we use them. They are junk
5410,Health & Beauty,4,"Everything OK: Good product, received on time, delivered undamaged."
5411,Health & Beauty,4,Good deal and they last a decent amount of time.
5412,Electronics,4,It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
5413,Health & Beauty,5,So far so good for our toddler's toys. Good value if they keep on keeping on!
5414,Health & Beauty,4,Received as promised
5415,Health & Beauty,5,So far the batch is worth it. The batteries are solid and work well. When they are on sale they are worth the buy.I recommend and would buy again.
5416,Health & Beauty,1,"Horrible! Did not last 1 hour, in my devices. DO NOT BUY!!"
5417,Electronics,4,"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
5418,Health & Beauty,5,cheaper alternatibve and bulk price is right.
5419,Health & Beauty,5,Solid product
5420,Health & Beauty,5,Will certainly get more.
5421,Electronics,4,Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
5422,Electronics,4,"Got this for my nephew, he loves it. Downloaded a ton of content and still super quick. However the cameras are AWFUL!!!!"
5423,Electronics,4,We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
5424,Health & Beauty,5,"Been happy with Amazon batteries. Dont' see much difference vs the duracell that I usually buy. So now, i just the the amazon. This is the 3rd set that I have bought. They are so cheap that I give them with gifts. The parents and kids love me because they usually don't' have batteries."
5425,Electronics,4,"I like the closed ecosystem, your kids don't see what they shouldn't, what i didn't like my daughter made a purchase by mistake on day 2, turnoff the the one click buying. also i don't like that its set up like its the parents device with the child using it, so there are two steps to logging in. also i don't like the lack of google apps, the device itself itself has a great screen and weight, the bumper is tough and easy to clean, and overall i would recommend it for a 4yo."
5426,Electronics,1,"I'm sure its a great product but there was something wrong with the one I ordered on target.com. My daughter opened it on Christmas morning and was so excited. We went to charge it and it wouldn't turn on. We tried holding the power button down for 40 seconds like the amazon website suggests, nothing, we left it charging for hours and still nothing. Very disappointed."
5427,Health & Beauty,4,It worked great I like it you can't beat the price you get a lot for your money
5428,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries for a good price.
5429,Health & Beauty,5,Good value and work as well as the brand names.
5430,Health & Beauty,5,"Work just as good as Duracell, Energizer, etc. Great Price."
5431,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are absolute garbage. Very little capacity.
5432,Health & Beauty,5,I just got them today came pretty quickly neatly wrapped cant wait to use them
5433,Electronics,4,I bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. It keeps him busy while my wife and I take him out to dinner at a restaurant. It's relatively easy to use and he likes some of the kids videos we downloaded for free.
5434,Health & Beauty,5,Good battery.
5435,Health & Beauty,1,"The batteries I got have very little charge left in them. 2 batteries only lasted 2 days in my Wii remote, whereas other batteries lasted weeks. V"
5436,Health & Beauty,3,"I have not had them long but they seem to be doing the job that is required. I will check back in later to discuss battery life if I remember. I will say, that I could have found batteries a bit cheaper around town and on the internet so I probably will not buy these again for this reason."
5437,Electronics,2,"I should have done some research before buying the Tap. I would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated. Also, I thought it would be more like Siri where you can ask anything. Alexa's answer to most questions is, ""I don't understand the question."" The Bluetooth speaker works fine."
5438,Electronics,4,Good loud sound. Very good speaker. Convenient voice commands to take outside of house.
5439,Health & Beauty,5,great value
5440,Health & Beauty,5,Great product!
5441,Electronics,3,This device is a good if you are looking for a starter tablet for a young individual.
5442,Health & Beauty,5,A++
5443,Electronics,4,Great tablet for simple uses... not an iPad but it performs the base needs
5444,Health & Beauty,2,"not worth the money, they did not last very long, batteries would go dead, will not buy again"
5445,Health & Beauty,5,good batteries.
5446,Health & Beauty,5,Great prices right here!
5447,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries!!!
5448,Health & Beauty,5,These are alright batteries works well on remotes and other little gadgets. I just like my energize battery or the copper top battery myself but my husband got these for the smaller items around here.
5449,Electronics,4,We got this product for our 6 year old. I love the parental controls. Only downfalls I've noticed so far is it takes a long time to charge and there is a lot going on app. Wise on the parent login on this product.
5450,Health & Beauty,5,works like it should
5451,Electronics,4,Great 1st tablet for my little nephew downloaded great games and after he dropped it twice still works and looks amazing lol
5452,Health & Beauty,5,Works as expected
5453,Electronics,4,"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
5454,Health & Beauty,4,They're batteries.
5455,Health & Beauty,5,My family goes through a lot of AA and AAA batteries. I've been buying bulk packs of AmazonBasics Performance Alkaline Batteries for a few years now and my household expenditures on batteries have gone down by nearly half. I don't see any difference in the overall performance or life of these batteries when compared to Duracell or EverReady alkaline batteries and they cost quite a bit less.
5456,Electronics,4,Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
5457,Health & Beauty,4,Ok.
5458,Health & Beauty,4,AOK
5459,Health & Beauty,5,Very pleased.
5460,Electronics,1,The ads that pop up constantly make us almost unusable for kids.
5461,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are horrible. We depend on AA batteries for many wireless microphone and have found that brand-name batteries last about a month per our usage. We switched to Amazon basics to try it out when a subscription for our preferred brand was no longer available and have found that, under the same usage, these batteries last about a week. That's a 1/4 capacity."
5462,"Toys & Games,Electronics",1,She uses it every day. She can't get enough of it.
5463,Health & Beauty,5,Great set of batteries! Cheaper than competitors and do are long lasting!
5464,Electronics,4,This was the first tablet we purchased for our kids and love it.
5465,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
5466,Electronics,4,"It's easy and intuitive. The only criticism is that it should be easier to go right into an application, instead of watching an advertisement, then having to figure out how to exit it"
5467,Electronics,4,Gift for my mother for Christmas. It's her first tablet. Right price to see if she likes it or not.
5468,Health & Beauty,4,"Usually I buy bricks of batteries from Fry's Electronics, but I had an Amazon gift card, so I figured I would give them a shot and they make my devices work!"
5469,Health & Beauty,5,Great batteries.
5470,Electronics,2,"Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy."
5471,Electronics,4,Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
5472,Electronics,4,Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
5473,Health & Beauty,5,buzzing with energy!
5474,Health & Beauty,3,"Ordered on accident when I had searched for RECHARGEABLE batteries. Not happy. I will be less free about ordering on Amazon from now on. My fault, but it made my put up my guard."
5475,Health & Beauty,5,does its jobs
5476,Health & Beauty,5,"awesome, Perfect!"
5477,Health & Beauty,4,Value for money
5478,Health & Beauty,5,Thanks
5479,Health & Beauty,4,does what batteries should do
5480,Health & Beauty,4,"These don't seem to last *quite* as long as Energizer or Duracell, but they are cheaper."
5481,Electronics,4,Just wish i could lock the screen so my daughter cant exit apps!
5482,Health & Beauty,5,ASDFGHJ
5483,Health & Beauty,3,"These batteries seem to not last as long as other batteries I have used. They feel like they're made of good material, but they don't last as long as I would like them to."
5484,Health & Beauty,5,Love this 20 pack. WOuld order again if I needed to
5485,Health & Beauty,1,Many of these batteries are not working at all. Very disappointed.
5486,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are a good value and work well. I have used them in the past and would recommend them to all.
5487,Health & Beauty,5,Great price and last a long time
5488,Electronics,3,meh. it works. i find it difficult to navigate. i also have an ipad mini. this seems to be less intuitive than the ipad.
5489,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for quantity!
5490,Health & Beauty,3,doesn't last very long
5491,Electronics,3,I would recommend this tablet for an older child. Maybe 7 and up.
5492,Electronics,4,"The first tablet I bought was good at first until it stops charging. I went to best buy to check it and they said that everything is okay. We tried it again at home and it was the same thing, it charged for a few min until probably 2% and will stop. I brought it back to the store and they replace it with a new one. So far I don't have problem with it as well as the other 2 tablets that I bought together with the first tablet."
5493,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Got this for my kids they wont put it down but can be confusing with setup
5494,Electronics,4,"I love it hut I think I should have got the bigger one, but its entertaining"
5495,Health & Beauty,1,"I've been using these on my roku remote and the lifespan is terrible. About two weeks, when Duracell's have been 1-2 months"
5496,Health & Beauty,1,Two batteries of he the twenty were leaking in the Package on delivery. With a ten year warranty against leakage...that is not a good start
5497,Electronics,4,"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
5498,Health & Beauty,1,They paired these with a order that uses AA
5499,Electronics,4,Bought this for all four of my children and they loved it.
5500,Health & Beauty,5,Perfect - thank you!
5501,Electronics,4,good for reading for a long hours since battery last over 6 hours. I will recommend it to my relatives and friendas
5502,Electronics,1,I bought this on line as a gift. The unit does not stay on and I cannot get in touch with anyone to get the unit repaired
5503,Health & Beauty,5,works well
5504,Health & Beauty,4,So they are batterues as described - should be enough for a long time.
5505,Health & Beauty,5,Super Price and they are fully charged. My end year date was 2026
5506,Health & Beauty,5,Good price for these batteries
5507,Electronics,4,"my kid loves it of course. I haven't had a chance to look at it's potential for parent use, like email. Seems like a winner."
5508,Electronics,4,Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
5509,Health & Beauty,5,As expected
5510,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for kids. The bumper around the tablet has saved it several times. I might buy a larger screen tablet the next time around. The programs are easy to access and love the parental controls.
5511,Health & Beauty,5,received as described
5512,Health & Beauty,5,Can't beat them for the price.
5513,Health & Beauty,4,Great price for AA batteries. I needed a lot of them to maintain battery-powered Xmas window candles. These seem to be working fine. Easy-open cardboard package is very convenient.
5514,Health & Beauty,4,"should have bought the bigger pack, used most of these up already, forgot how much stuff I had that uses AAA batteries."
5515,Health & Beauty,4,Seem to be working out well.
5516,Health & Beauty,5,"Love these, I go through the batteries so nice to get more for my money."
5517,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,The kids feature is great. My 18 month old takes it with her everywhere. Love how I can block unwanted content from her profile. Very kid friendly.
5518,Health & Beauty,2,"not a fan, seem to run out quick"
5519,Electronics,4,We got this tablet for my son and it has been a great fit. The screen is sharp but the tablet is a little sluggish. Considering the price and that it is intended for children I think it is great.
5520,Electronics,4,I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
5521,Health & Beauty,5,"Amazing deal on these batteries! We have six kids so we are always needing batteries for something - whether it be a game, or a computer mouse, or whatever ... we always need a good stock of batteries. As far as holding up and doing the job, they seem to be doing great! I will update if I find any problems. So far, so good. Will need to buy more once Christmas gets closer."
5522,Health & Beauty,4,nothing more to say
5523,Health & Beauty,5,good
5524,Health & Beauty,4,"Batteries worked well, just as well as the store bought ones but at a better price"
5525,Health & Beauty,5,Great basic batteries! Fantastic price. I like having a stockpile. When my kids get toys at Christmas I feel like Oprah. YOU get a battery! and YOU get a battery!...
5526,Electronics,4,This product is very good to use .I recommend for my friends.Very easy to use
5527,Electronics,3,Kindle fire is slow but love the fact my child is protected from some internet content
5528,Health & Beauty,3,poor quality short life cannot recharge
5529,Health & Beauty,5,"Everything about AmazonBasics is amazing. Anything we have ever ordered that was AmazonBasics has always worked beautifully. The batteries arrived, in what would appear to be recycled packaging, which is good on them. No issue with any of the batteries we ordered, including these AA."
5530,Electronics,3,"I bought this as a gift to my parents. The unfortunate part was that I was a little misinformed about the connectivity between the tablet and a chrome cast that I purchases as well as part of the gift. The tablet is not compatible with the table and that was a little disappointing. Other than that, it's an alright product."
5531,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries only last 2-3 days in my tv remote
5532,Health & Beauty,5,Comparable in quality to the more expensive brands. No issues so far with the quality of this batteries. I will buy again.
5533,Health & Beauty,4,"Good price, hopefully they last."
5534,Electronics,4,Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
5535,Electronics,4,"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
5536,Electronics,4,"This was a excellent gift for the family, A good choice."
5537,Health & Beauty,5,Works
5538,Electronics,4,"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
5539,Health & Beauty,1,"Please be aware that these batteries leak! I put these in a few electric candles and alarm clocks in our house, after a few days the bottom of the candles and clocks were coated with battery acid. No other battery brands have done this in our house before. I cannot tell you if they last long or not, got rid of them immediately."
5540,Electronics,1,Worst product ever. Constantly screwing up and filled with ads you have to pay to remove. Best Buy refused to help when I wanted to return it
5541,Health & Beauty,3,do not last as long as energizer...very comparable to toys r us batteries
5542,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries hold their charge rather well. I find them comparable to the other brands I use.
5543,Electronics,4,I bought this kindle for my mother. She is a beginner and has really adjusted to it. Nice tablet.
5544,Health & Beauty,5,Love
5545,Health & Beauty,3,They do not last long.
5546,Electronics,4,"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
5547,Health & Beauty,1,I feel like the batteries wasted quickly. It did not last as long as store bought batteries.
5548,Health & Beauty,5,great for battery sucking xbox one controllers
5549,Health & Beauty,3,These batteries have a tendency to leak inside of devices and cause damage rendering them in operable
5550,Health & Beauty,5,Great Price!
5551,Electronics,2,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
5552,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries seem to last as long as the more expensive gold/black batteries. All of the Amazon Basics items we have bought have been of excellent quality.
5553,Electronics,3,This is going to be a Christmas gift for my granddaughter so we don't know how good it is yet but we where going to put so games on it so it is ready to go and we couldn't because you have to have a amazon account to do anything with it.
5554,Electronics,4,This gizmo is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the Alexa world!
5555,Electronics,4,So far I haven't had any trouble with this tablet. Only thing that sucks is this I can't text from it. If anyone who's an app for it let me know! Thank you !
5556,Electronics,4,"I got it on a offer. For the price I paid, I'm not complaining. It does its work, not the fastest but it should do it."
5557,Health & Beauty,5,Work great great price.
5558,Health & Beauty,1,"Of the 6 I used so far, out of the box and wrapper, completely dead... thanks..."
5559,Electronics,4,Would have gotten 5 stars but the screen is to light when put on dark screen for reading. All the adds make it feel cluttered but that might just be me. Over all for price it is a nice ereader.
5560,Electronics,4,"Upgraded from a paperwhite and the build quality of this unit is much, much better! Just it's kind of expensive for an e-reader."
5561,Electronics,4,Its an alright tablet but I wish you could download more apps.
5562,Electronics,4,Does as advertise. Good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers.
5563,Electronics,4,Purchased as a gift for my nephew He's was very happy with this item no complaints
5564,Electronics,4,This little sorcerer's box displays magical pictures and bright pretty colors.
5565,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,My 1 year old loves his tablet. He knows how to utilize it very well. It needs a better camera.
5566,Health & Beauty,5,good price
5567,Health & Beauty,5,I like this AmazonBasics. Got household items for less. Love it
5568,Health & Beauty,3,"These do not last long. I will stick to Kirkland or Duracell from now on. I usually change my mouse battery once a year, and since I started using these, it is every other month. Disappointing."
5569,Health & Beauty,5,These work just as well as any other brand and here I am several months later with a nice stock of batteries. The price/value of this pack cannot be beat.
5570,Electronics,4,Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
5571,Electronics,1,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
5572,Electronics,4,my brother still doesn't have a smart phone. i bought this device as an introduction to him to the Apple world. he loves it.
5573,Electronics,4,its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
5574,Electronics,4,I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
5575,Health & Beauty,4,Decent batteries. Seem like they do not last as long as Duracell or other brands.
5576,Health & Beauty,5,always there when I need them.
5577,Electronics,4,"Purchased 4 of these tablets as Xmas gifts and the interface is perfect.What a great deal for $50 8gig version.Wife was so intrigued by Alexa voice,now she wants one.The best tablet deal I ever purchased."
5578,Health & Beauty,5,"Wonderful value. At Walmart, an 8 pack of duracell is like 14 now."
5579,Electronics,1,This is not like other android tablets in a bad way.
5580,Electronics,4,It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
5581,Health & Beauty,4,These batteries seem to hold up as well as any other batteries I've used and they are cheaper than the name brand batteries I had been using.
5582,Health & Beauty,5,very good
5583,Health & Beauty,5,last a long time
5584,Electronics,3,"This is the 2nd one I have bought. The first one went out before the 1 year. I contacted Amazon and the warranty for these was only 90 days. It is a good tablet for kids, but if you are looking for something long term. I would spend the extra $$ for at least something that has a 1 year limited warranty."
5585,Electronics,4,Bought for my mom as a gift. She's not tech savvy but it's easy for her to get used to. Definitely a good tablet for beginners.
5586,Health & Beauty,4,"They don't last as Duracell or Energizer. For the price, it's a good buy."
5587,Health & Beauty,5,A great inexpensive rout for your AA needs! Just as good as the expensive name brand batteries!
5588,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal!
5589,Health & Beauty,5,Great price for that many battery's they last along time
5590,Electronics,2,"Maybe I had higher expectationin general i will not recommend since the service of Amazon solving situations is not as good as in other products, I've had so much troubles with the amazon free time, I am even not longer using it (it was one of the ""big"" features on the advertisment. I will recommend to look for other alternatives before to take a decision on buying this product"
5591,Electronics,4,"It's a nice tablet for the price and I use it for a lot of things around the house , TV , tempeture"
5592,Health & Beauty,5,good deal
5593,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This is an awesome tablet for kids. Love the versatility. This is our 2nd since our older son loved his, we felt his younger brother needed one too. The charger is horrible though. Does not charge well at all. Returned the first kindle thinking it was the tablet. After the second had problems charging, I tried my husbands galaxy charger and it fits perfectly. Then we bought this one. Same problem. The charger that comes with the kindle simply does not fit well and give it a good charge. All 3 tablets had the same issue. I have also spoke to other parents who have experienced the same issue. So in summary, the tablet is aweosme. The charger is awful."
5594,Health & Beauty,5,Fair price. EZ open package (thanks Amazon). seem to last. Why pay more
5595,Health & Beauty,5,Great basic alkaline batteries at a terrific price.
5596,Health & Beauty,5,"Easy decision, the amazon basics line of products has always worked well for me, and amazon customer service on their stuff is amazing if you need it.There is little difference in Alkaline batteries. (Costco hits top rank in consumer reports, but I have not seen their amazon battery rating.)But ordering from amazon is so easy, and the quality is good"
5597,Health & Beauty,3,IT'S A BATTERY
5598,Health & Beauty,1,These batteries are terrible. All of my clocks (bought in this same order) need new batteries already because they are all dying. I now have to buy all Energizer batteries. :-(
5599,Health & Beauty,4,"They don't last as long as the major brands, but for the price you can't beat it."
5600,Health & Beauty,1,I was searching for rechargeable batteries and these came up. I did think it was a great price for rechargeable batteries so I bought two packs. Didn't realize they were regular batteries until they arrived. I was a little annoyed. I blame Amazon for showing me these when I was looking for something else.
5601,Health & Beauty,4,"in my eyes, they die to quickly"
5602,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,It's good for small children. They cannot get to setting too easily
5603,"Electronics,Media",4,I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
5604,Health & Beauty,5,Works like a regular battery
5605,Health & Beauty,1,Returned for later purchase
5606,Health & Beauty,4,have not used yet but a battery is a battery good price
5607,Health & Beauty,5,just as adverised - fast shipping
5608,Health & Beauty,5,great
5609,Health & Beauty,2,These don't last like good batteries. But are a great price. If you have kids that leave toys on and run out batteries then these are good. I don't use them in the remote or anything I want to rely on for long term use.
5610,Electronics,4,"There's different things my daughter can do,on it, plus I can read on it as well."
5611,Electronics,4,I just wish it was a little less easy for a toddler to get out of apps. They'll be on a game or show and accidentally...or purposly tap around out of curiosity and it closes the app. It needs less sensitivity but is it is still a great tablet for toddlers and up. The first one broke and I couldn't tell you how it happened. I think I had two of press down on it or something because I had it next to me trying to download apps then turned around in the whole screen was completely cracked up like someone hit it with a hammer. Since then I haven't had any issue with the new one
5612,Electronics,4,Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
5613,Health & Beauty,4,For most applications they seem to do a decent job. Have used them for about 3 years.
5614,Health & Beauty,3,Seems as good as Duracell but can't really tell.
5615,Electronics,4,Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
5616,Electronics,4,This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
5617,Electronics,4,Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
5618,Electronics,4,A good product that provides the services I desire.
5619,Health & Beauty,5,Great value batteries. Work well and nice price.
5620,Health & Beauty,5,Best value in batteries
5621,Health & Beauty,1,garbage
5622,Health & Beauty,1,Alot of the batteries were dead or very weak
5623,Electronics,4,"This is my first Fire Kindle. I love it. It is fast, and has good internet. It gives me quick access to all my Kindle library. I found out it's easier to scroll through the pages than when using Kindle Touch."
5624,Electronics,3,I'm disappointed that it doesn't have a mirror display mode.
5625,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Bought this for my daughter to keep her busy in the car and flights. Works great. Good content.
5626,Health & Beauty,4,as expected.
5627,Electronics,3,returning for a replacement. It got wet and quite working for a child's device it should be better made.
5628,Health & Beauty,5,They work well
5629,Health & Beauty,4,they work as any battery should.
5630,Health & Beauty,2,They do not last as long and I had hoped. Meaning they run down really fast. Would not buy again.
5631,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Great way to read books available for downloads from the library
5632,Electronics,4,Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
5633,Electronics,4,I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
5634,Health & Beauty,5,yes they last just as long as the expensive kind.
5635,Electronics,4,We love our tablets waiting recommend it to my friends
5636,Health & Beauty,4,Great product.
5637,Health & Beauty,5,The product came on time and as described. I am glad I bought this! I always research before I buy and this was a good deal.
5638,Health & Beauty,1,These do not last long. Will never buy again
5639,Electronics,4,"Bought as a gift for my Mom. She's so happy. Therefore, I'm happy"
5640,Electronics,4,"The screen is great on the Fire HD 8. This tablet was given to a child and she loves the tablet. The only thing I don't like about the whole Amazon experience is the advertisement. Other than that, the tablet is nice."
5641,Health & Beauty,1,"These batteries are HORRIBLE. I purchased the 36 pack of AAA's a few months ago, and just started using them last week. So far out of 5 batteries used 2 were DOA, 2 lasted 4 days and 1 got so hot the plastic around the end is burnt."
5642,Health & Beauty,2,Only 3 worked out of the entire pack.
5643,Electronics,4,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
5644,Health & Beauty,1,Not sure I will be buying these again. The first four pack I opened was dead. The second pack worked but only lasted half the time a name brand battery lasts. I am using more batteries for the same amount of use in my headset. I won't be buying these again.
5645,Health & Beauty,5,exactly as described
5646,Health & Beauty,5,great value and the batteries last just as long if not longer than name brands.
5647,Electronics,4,Wife likes it. She uses it when she travels. Does'nt like to carry alot of books.
5648,Health & Beauty,4,great batteries works extremely well and we put it on our smoke detectors have to change them once a monthwill buy again
5649,Health & Beauty,5,"no problems,arrived quickly"
5650,Health & Beauty,1,I ordered a ton of these for holiday candle lights. They are in for 6 hours each night and turn off on a timer. We are 15 days in and every single candle (34 of them) is so dim you can barely see them.Expected to get far more life out of these. Do not recommend.
5651,Health & Beauty,1,Trash. Only lasted a few hours.
5652,Health & Beauty,5,These work as well as the name brand batteries but with the convenience of delivery!
5653,Health & Beauty,4,Good value
5654,Electronics,4,Great product for the price . Could do away with the adds . But for what you pay they have to make some money somehow . Would give 5 stars if the adds were not on this tablet factory ore loaded .
5655,Electronics,4,"This is the second Kid's version of the Fire that I've purchased and I think it's a good deal. Since it's really for my kids to watch Netflix - I was looking for a cheap option. I thought about getting the $50 option, but I would have bought a case and paid to turn off the ads anyway. So adding it up, I feel like I didn't spend much more than I was going to anyway - AND I get the 2 year warranty included. Not bad in my opinion. And it does a fine job with Netflix streaming so far."
5656,Electronics,4,This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
5657,Health & Beauty,4,"I don't notice any difference between these batteries and premium brand name ones They seem to last just as long, and at a great price."
5658,Electronics,4,It's not bad for the novelty of Alexa. Might as well get the echo. Sound it not bad and I'm no audiophile. Might be good when my echo dots come in. Is it worth it? There are better Bluetooth speakers out there.
5659,Electronics,4,"This is well constructed for kids. My biggest reason I don't like it is it asks for a credit card, for a kids tablet. I suggest you buy a prepaid credit card or a Amazon gift card for game purchases!"
5660,Health & Beauty,5,good value
5661,Electronics,4,We're in our 70s and and have a good time with it.
5662,Electronics,4,very durable and easy to work with. I love its functionality and my kid loves having his own tablet. good stuff
5663,Electronics,4,"Just installed, but like it so far. The picture is clear and the price is affordable."
5664,Electronics,4,Great speaker. Love how its portable. Good battery life. Would be 5 stars if it had the drop in capabilities like the rest of the echo family.
5665,Electronics,4,Very Affordable. I gave this as a gift so I am not sure how well it works.
5666,Health & Beauty,5,"Good or better than Durcell at much less cost. Made in Indonesia, not China."
5667,Health & Beauty,5,good so far!
5668,Health & Beauty,3,ok
5669,Health & Beauty,5,These seem to last just fine for games and toys. Great value.
5670,Electronics,4,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
5671,Electronics,4,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
5672,Electronics,4,My 2 year old son loves this tablet. He is very engaged with the educational apps that the tablet has. Its easy to navigate. I would recommend to anyone
5673,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, great price."
5674,Electronics,4,This can be shared will multiple family members. You can have kids and adults use the same tablet and keep each separated.
5675,Electronics,4,"Quite light, easy to conceal, easy to use and quite quick."
5676,"Electronics,Media",4,The design is good. Love to read books with this beautiful device. The battery is not very good though.
5677,Health & Beauty,5,This is a great deal and I will certainly order again!
5678,Health & Beauty,2,I'm not particularly happy four of them have already had to be replaced they don't last very long
5679,Health & Beauty,5,Nice affordable pack of batteries. I provide photos of what the packaging looks like.
5680,Electronics,4,Purchased mainly to use travelling so haven't really had the opportunity to give it a fair road test at this point. It was advertised as capable of downloading movies and books so you can watch/read while travelling without burning through your data or being hit with data roaming fees or having to purchase wifi during flights.
5681,Electronics,4,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.
5682,Health & Beauty,4,"They seem to do well so far, I can't complain, good price and on time"
5683,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work as good as any battery out there on the market today.
5684,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Reminded my son and I of his old early generation Kindle that worked so well.
5685,Health & Beauty,3,These batteries just don't seem to last as long as Everready batteries.
5686,Health & Beauty,5,awesome
5687,Health & Beauty,5,had it for my xbox controller it works really good.
5688,Health & Beauty,5,The batteries appear to last just as long as the bunny and other major brands.
5689,Health & Beauty,5,I was impressed how well these work and how poorly some of the brand names don't. Glad I got them!
5690,Electronics,2,"It is too heavy for its size! I purchased it to replace a larger Nook, and find that it weighs as much. Screen is attractive but it even with a good signal in public places, hanging on to Wifi is difficult. It is not efficient when downloading (buffering, buffering...) and I am still debating returning it for another tablet."
5691,Health & Beauty,1,"I just went to use these for the first time... and they exploded in the remote I put them in! Literally, a loud pop and a black liquid was leaking out into my remote and all over my hands. Needless to say, it scared me to death!"
5692,Health & Beauty,5,The power is yours!
5693,Electronics,4,"Bought for my kid, it's great for him, the apps are good, the free time, bumper and warranty make it worry free!"
5694,Health & Beauty,5,very good.
5695,Electronics,4,Got tablet for my daughter..love everything about it and how easy it is to use.
5696,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"I am loving my new Kindle! I have wanted one for a while and finally bought one, and even though it was the cheapest one, it has exceeded my expectations. I love how there is no glare."
5697,Electronics,4,"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
5698,Health & Beauty,3,Haven't use the batteries at this time and expect 5 star performance.
5699,Electronics,4,"For its price, this a great little tablet. It does have limitations on what it can do and what apps are available for use with it which is the only reason I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Hopefully Amazon will allow it to perform better soon."
5700,Electronics,4,The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
5701,Health & Beauty,5,One of the best values on Amazon
5702,Electronics,4,"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
5703,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality. Much better than Kirkland brand we use to buy
5704,Health & Beauty,5,as expected
5705,Health & Beauty,3,Basic quality
5706,Health & Beauty,3,They are ok batteries. I use them on my remotes and have to switch out frequently.
5707,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,Great for the kids but not much space for all the apps they want.
5708,Health & Beauty,5,"Awesome price, awesome batteries. I will never buy batteries anywhere else again, this deal is hard to beat."
5709,Electronics,4,Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
5710,Electronics,4,"Tablets have come a long way. This is much better than my piece of junk nextbook. For the 70-75 dollars, I bought this for it is great and stays on wifi much better than my old tablet. It is small enough to travel with and browses much faster online than what I used to use. The sound quality is not bad.... and I will also give a spoiler that neither style of apple earbuds will work with this. I have some cheap earbuds that will work with the fire."
5711,Health & Beauty,4,"Can't beat the price. Alkaline is not the best tech - but it is a low cost battery. I'm NOT really okay that Amazon owns the marketplace and also competes against manufacturers like Duracell. They've got the upper hand. Something seems unfair about this situation. Amazon should not be competing with manufacturers - I won't buy these again. Right product wrong maker. Amazon will soon be making everything and shipping it directly in its own boats and aircraft from offshore. Is that good for me Yes, because it saves me money. Is it good for America Not really - it kills jobs. I'm going to pay a little bit more and buy my batteries elsewhere."
5712,Health & Beauty,4,"they are batteries.....they work, or they work. I guess they work"
5713,Health & Beauty,2,"Amazon seems to have changed the manufacturer of this battery. I liked it very much the last year, but the new one has a different look, has noticeably lower capacity, and leaks. Batteries usually leak after they die, but these leaked while they were still good... and apparently died because of the leak. All of my devices have battery monitored One day they were good with 50-90 power left, and they died suddenly the next day. The leaks were mostly minor but clearly noticeable from body discoloration.One thing that has not changed from before is the packaging, and it is still bad. They are shrink-wrapped 4 in a package and they are hard to open as there is no cut-out or pull-tab to break the wrap. It is difficult to break open by hand. Twisting the package causes undue stress to the batteries and that may be cause of the leak. I have had to use scissors or knife to cut open the package."
5714,Health & Beauty,1,Cheap price but they sure don't last very long. I won't buy the Amazn brand again.
5715,"Electronics,Media",4,"Got me reading again! Love the merlot cover. This one is the smallest of all the kindle products I believe, and that's a big reason I picked. Also the lightest I believe. Battery life is forever.Two negative points are the Amazon logo in the cover, and the fact you can't do inverted text (black background white text).Those 2 points dropped it from 4 to 5 star for me.Still highly recommended."
5716,Electronics,4,Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
5717,Electronics,4,Exactly what I expected. I own three of these already.
5718,Health & Beauty,2,Does not last. Very short life span.
5719,Health & Beauty,4,Not bad for the price only time will tell if good bye
5720,Health & Beauty,1,Half the batteries had no charge.
5721,Health & Beauty,5,Seem to work fine!
5722,Health & Beauty,4,Very satisfied.
5723,Electronics,4,the fire hd is great for reading kindle books . Its pretty slow for surfing the web. If your looking for a great kindle this is it. I would not recommend this for surfing the web.
5724,Health & Beauty,5,Good bang for your buck. Won't have to go out and buy batteries for the year!
5725,Health & Beauty,4,they're good
5726,Electronics,4,This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
5727,Health & Beauty,5,"AmazonBasics AA Alkaline batteries, are generic alkaline batteries as good as Duracel Rayovac."
5728,Health & Beauty,4,I haven't even used one yet but I suspect they will work. I stocked up on these because I have a lot of stuff that uses AAA's and it is a super price.
5729,Health & Beauty,5,GREAT!!!!!
5730,Health & Beauty,1,these suck! They run out in literally just a few days. I have used several sets of these for my AC thermostat which is battery powered and the thermostat died every few days when using amazon brand batteries. using Duracell or energizer - they last for at least a few mos. I will never buy amazon batteries again. You get what you pay for.
5731,Electronics,4,"Amazing tablet for the price. Lightning quick, screen quality is great and it has a great feel to it. It's only limitation it's the Amazon app store."
5732,Health & Beauty,5,QUALITY BATTERIES
5733,Health & Beauty,5,Cheap and easy batteries in an easy open package that is also recyclable and good for storage. Perfect for those toys (child and adult toys) that are constantly using batteries. I wish Amazon offered a package with prepaid return postage for recycling. I would pay an extra dollar or something if I could pack them back in the box and ship them back to Amazon for recycling. YOU HEAR THAT AMAZON
5734,Electronics,4,"Great buy after owning the original kindle Fire, it's very versatile and shows the progress made from the original. You can't lose and pair it with Amazon Prime."
5735,Electronics,4,"I was looking to upgrade from my old Kindle reader and stumbled on the Fire HD which is not only a reader but a tablet as well. Fairly easy to use. I really only needed to read books but how have a tablet as well. I wish it supported all google play apps and not just Amazon apps but I can check email and get to the web so it serves the purpose. But...when I want to read in the middle of the night, getting to the web can be distracting."
5736,Health & Beauty,4,"Work as well as major brands, as far as I can tell, but for a much better price."
5737,Health & Beauty,5,Great value on amazon basic batteries.
5738,Health & Beauty,3,Not the longest lasting. But good for the price.
5739,Electronics,4,I bought this as a first time tablet for my mother. She has really learned to use it freely. The color and size are perfect for her. She uses it mainly to search the internet and check her emails. Great starter. I am going to download some books for her to read as she travels.
5740,Health & Beauty,5,Batteries that get the job done. Cool packaging. Amazon claims another industry.
5741,Electronics,4,Great device and easy setup.The ease of use for the kids are also great.
5742,Electronics,3,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
5743,Health & Beauty,1,Dollar store Sunbeam batteries lasted longer than these crappy things. So disappointing!
5744,Health & Beauty,4,"They are batteries, and low cost. Don't know how long they will last yet. Tell you more on that, when the time comes."
5745,Health & Beauty,4,Hi folks... these are just good all around batteries. Used them for years.
5746,Health & Beauty,5,Good quality and value
5747,Health & Beauty,3,They ran out of energy very quick but it's a deal
5748,Electronics,4,"My stepkids are pretty rough on their toys and these have lasted pretty darn well so far. Easy to update and add games, apps and school related material. Go for it if you are looking for a pretty darn decent tablet for the lil ones"
5749,Electronics,4,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
5750,Health & Beauty,5,Battery good life span
5751,Electronics,3,Good tablet for kids. Lots of appts to download for games
5752,Health & Beauty,5,Best deal around!
5753,Electronics,4,Great price for an easy to use tablet. Excellent for reading ebooks.
5754,Electronics,4,Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it was a good buyShock proof and great educational apps for kids in it
5755,Health & Beauty,4,A good value but I'm still using them so don't know how long they will last. To be continued
5756,Electronics,3,"At first I wanted to return this product, I bought it for my 2 yr old. I decided to keep it bc my husband liked it and of course my daughter likes it. I dnt like the fact you cant use the audible app on the kids version. I also bought it so my daughter could be independent, as far as the books none of them are read aloud. She came maneuver the games and movies tho. Its an ok product tho, I love Amazon. My daughter still likes my Samsung Tab better. Would recommend for older kids."
5757,Electronics,4,"It works well for me, however, my wife seems to have cold fingers, and the touch screen does not always respond. One other odd quirk. If the tablet is turned off, and you plug it in to charge it, it automatically turns on. You then have to wait until it boots, and then turn it off again. This is very annoying. Before recommending to someone, I would tell them about this annoying quirk."
5758,Health & Beauty,5,Nice amount of batteries to have for back up
5759,Health & Beauty,1,"Bought these in late Nov. By March 1, most of them were dead in the package."
5760,Electronics,3,"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
5761,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
5762,Health & Beauty,1,More than half did not work
5763,Electronics,3,"Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet."
5764,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"We bought this for our 7 year old and at first we had some issues loading things, but things seem to be working great now. He loves it and he can play games and load apps. Just what we wanted it for."
5765,Electronics,4,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
5766,Health & Beauty,5,I am delighted with my puchase!
5767,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent quality
5768,Electronics,4,"Great device and deal, specifically for the little ones"
5769,Health & Beauty,5,great product
5770,Health & Beauty,4,solid AAA batteries that last na expected ammount of time. packaging easy and this is a seriously convenient option. Will always use this now as the price point and convenience make any other batteries a less economical choice.
5771,Health & Beauty,4,Arrived as advertised and ahead of schedule. Not quite as long lasting as a major name brand but good for the price point.
5772,Health & Beauty,2,I originally wanted to buy Duracell brand batteries but I bought these instead (Aug. 2016) as they were cheaper. I just today had to remove a set of these from a remote thermometer and they had leaked even though the date printed on the batteries was Jan. 2025. My savings on these cheaper batteries was far less than the cost of my now damaged thermometer.
5773,Health & Beauty,5,WORK GREAT
5774,Health & Beauty,2,Not happy with quality. Do not last very long in various devices.My guess is that milliamp hour ratings are very poor/low.I have used many of these batteries in a short time span compared to Duracells.
5775,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,This a great tablet for child. I got this for my niece who is about to turn 3 years old. She love the games and the TV shows that was included with the tablet.
5776,Health & Beauty,2,"These suck! I may as well bought dollar tree batteries! We put them in three wreaths for Christmas lights that turn on for 4 hrs at night then turn themselves off with a timer and they burned out in three days, that's 12 HRS! Don't recommend...."
5777,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, lets see long they hold a charge."
5778,Health & Beauty,4,They work great and a price nicely
5779,Health & Beauty,4,"I don't think it last as longer as other brands, but it's ok."
5780,Electronics,4,Not to bad for a new kid to the tablet world. The screen is at times difficult to swipe with some games . But my Nephew seems to like it.
5781,Health & Beauty,5,They are batteries....
5782,Electronics,4,I got this for my daughter's for Christmas this is a great gift it helps them learn and keep them out of trouble thanks again Best Buy.
5783,Electronics,4,Good product but requires hands on to operate. Good if sitting close but not if you're mobile. Wold be great if portable and hands free. Returned it and ordered the Dot.
5784,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,"This is one of the perfect tab for kids, I bought it for my niece and she loved it."
5785,Health & Beauty,5,great
5786,Health & Beauty,5,Works great and lasts just as long as the name brands!!
5787,Electronics,4,GOOD DEVICE AND CHIPPER THAT SAMSUNG OR APPLE DEVICES.
5788,Electronics,4,"WISH the kindle fire (for kids) had better way to limit how many items you can download at once. Most kids do not understand that clicking on a bunch of pictures will download that game/program, which is CLOG download times. Needs a better way to remove unwanted items, rather than clicking.. and clicking on every item. Speed and performance is pretty good for a tablet. App store is great and has many items."
5789,Health & Beauty,5,Great buy!
5790,Health & Beauty,5,"Great product, of course. FAST shipping!"
5791,Health & Beauty,5,Good.
5792,Electronics,4,Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
5793,Health & Beauty,5,"Batteries seem to be fine , no problems . I would buy again"
5794,Health & Beauty,5,"The battery were pack in a plastic solid thing holding the battery inside of a very well made box. I have not tested the battery but the Do Not list is well thought out. It Has it in English,Chinse,Spanish,Dutch,French and One Other. This has to be why you should buy AmazonBasics battery instead of other people cause their prices higher than in stores for a cheap medium grade battery. I a real person and feel free to ask the oddest question.AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (8-Pack) - Packaging May Vary"
5795,Electronics,4,I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
5796,Electronics,2,Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
5797,Electronics,1,I bought this because I have ebooks in college. Not only could I not get my ebook. I called the school IT department. They could not either. My semester was already started. The sales representative at the store told me this is what I needed. I ended up buying a tablet from my phone carrier and my ebooks were right there in less than 5 minutes with the schools IT department help.
5798,Electronics,4,"Great for reading books, but I having to manually update the apps is a pain."
5799,Electronics,4,I really like it my complants is that it gives them to many choices that they try to pick all of the apps.
5800,Health & Beauty,4,as discribed
5801,Health & Beauty,5,AAA+++
5802,Electronics,1,"I do not like this Tablet one bit. It has to be registered with Amazon for it to function and it failed every time. I finally had to resort to calling Amazon's customer service, also not an easy task, to get it registered. There seems to be glitch in the programming, because when it failed again, I had to follow the same steps all over again to get it registered. I would highly recommend skipping this tablet and getting one that is not tied to any one company's operations, programming, or software."
5803,Electronics,4,Have been using this for a while and never believe it would be so handy and helpful. Product features are good and is quite handy to carry anywhere.
5804,Health & Beauty,5,good
5805,Health & Beauty,5,Fits my solar lights and couldn't find them in a store
5806,Electronics,4,Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
5807,Electronics,1,"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
5808,Electronics,4,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I struggled to find the right Bluetooth keyboard to go with my Kindle Fire HD. In the end, I decided to go with the Amazon one, figuring that because Amazon made the Fire and the keyboard, there would be fewer potential problems. At first, this was a good theory. I opened the keyboard as soon as it arrived and paired it immediately to my Kindle Fire HD. There were no problems and it worked perfectly.At first.Unfortunately for me, the next time I worked with the keyboard, I was on a plane trip. I decided to get some writing done (I write novels in my free time) and fired up the keyboard and the Fire. But this time, the keyboard wouldn't pair. At all. The Fire SAID the Keyboard could be paired -- it remembered they had been paired before -- but it just wouldn't pair it. I tried everything I could think of, including pressing the connect button on the keyboard several times to re-pair it. In the end, I had to give up. Instead, desperate to use the flight to write, I borrowed my wife's iPhone 4S. Oddly enough, that had NO problem connecting to the keyboard and I was writing in no time (albeit on a smaller screen and in the notes mode).When I arrived on vacation, I was worried I had a lemon on my hands. Sure, the keyboard worked, but not with the Fire, only the iPhone. That wasn't the plan. I noticed that other reviews said that the keyboard worked initially with the Fire and then wouldn't work again. I thought there was a major glitch.I decided to keep messing with it and discovered this problem and solution. If you ONLY pair the keyboard with the Fire, you will have no problems"
5809,Health & Beauty,5,Very nice packaging. Good batteries.
5810,Health & Beauty,4,good batteries purchased them based on other's review which help me to buy the batteries.
5811,Health & Beauty,2,they need to be change to offen
5812,Health & Beauty,5,I had never seen like this batteries with price and perform..
5813,Health & Beauty,3,There batteries do not last as long as Sam's or Costco brand batteries.
5814,Electronics,4,This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
5815,Health & Beauty,4,These work perfectly. Zero leaks! I switched from the Kirkland Brand at Costco and these work perfectly fine. Zero problems with the shipping because the box is well packaged.
5816,Electronics,4,"I'm not huge on kids using electronics, but my son (4) loves this when we take trips as he can play some of the downloaded games. We love it for when we want to get stuff done and still want him to be occupied and this does the trick. It's a little hard to navigate at first though."
5817,Health & Beauty,5,Nice battery and price. Have not had any problem with them.
5818,Health & Beauty,5,Very Good item.
5819,Electronics,2,"I loved this tablet. I did! BUT I did not love that I was being sold ads every time I powered up! I loathe even more that I would have had to pay $15 to discontinue that feature. Amazon if you want $105 dollars for the Kindle Fire, charge it! but don't under price the device, and then flash ads at the the consumer at every opportunity. It is unbecoming of you! I returned this item pronto!"
5820,Health & Beauty,4,Bulk is always the less expensive way to go for products like these
5821,Health & Beauty,4,Great item
5822,Health & Beauty,5,great price
5823,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Everything is great except that i can't read external pdfs properly. Either it zooms too much of too little. For kindle books it provides great experience. Battery life is awesome!
5824,Electronics,4,"The device is awesome! I bought it for my 6 year old son for Christmas and he loves it. The only problem I have with this fire and the older version that I also own is the poor selection of apps and games that Amazon offers. To get the better apps and games, I have to load Google play store onto it."
5825,Health & Beauty,1,These don't last long at all.
5826,Electronics,4,"The tablet is great and I like the warranty that it comes with, but I don't like the charging port. The wire that comes with the device is too short and will not fully snap into the device. Which will not let you charge the device unless you place it very carefully in the right position and then don't touch it. Had to buy an after market cable with an 8mm plug length to get it to charge. We bought 2 of the tablets and they both did the same thing. On one of the tablets we bought one of the magnetic plugs so that a younger children will not have problems with a loose plug."
5827,Electronics,2,I'm planning on returning this tablet just as soon as I can!`
5828,Health & Beauty,5,Last a long time!!! Better than competing brands.
5829,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,I love it it comes with a 12 month kids subscription
5830,Electronics,4,"Alexa do ........something? Welcome to the new interconnected world Circlers! Do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command? This may be for you! Do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopia of David Eggers ""The Circle"" and you want to escape from technology for a while? Then likely not, as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on Echo and Echo Dots, your life is still connected to Alexa via voice prompts! I liked using it for Amazon music, and the occasional Amazon Video, but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an Uber. Some people may feel they need technology to run their lives, I am not quite there yet and may never be! It is fun for what it does though, and it is a good bluetooth speaker!"
5831,Electronics,3,bought this during black friday (actually Thursday). ok for price. but not cool i had to buy extra storage for not a great price.
5832,Health & Beauty,1,Second purchase of an amazon battery product and just as disappointing as the first. Batteries don't last very long and they quickly leak battery acid. Installed for less than 1 year and already leaking in two separate devices stored in different conditions. Will never buy amazon batteries again. Definitely not worth the few dollars saved.
5833,Health & Beauty,5,They work.
5834,Electronics,4,My Grandma likes it a lot. For the basic book reader nothing beats it for the money.
5835,Electronics,4,"Overall it's okay, I don't like that it takes forever to charge."
5836,Electronics,4,Perfect for what I need to use it for movies etc great for a gift
5837,Electronics,4,I purchased this tablet for my grandmother to use. She loves it. It is easy to navigate for her. The only thing that annoys her is when the apps need to be updated. She does not have internet at home so she has to wait to update her apps when she visits family (who has internet service).
5838,Health & Beauty,1,Terrible!! The batteries drained way too fast. We put them in wreaths with lights and went dead within 2 days. They were timed for 4 hours so it's not on for long. We used Energizer batteries last year and worked for the 20 days that were on display and didn't have to change any. But I guess for 24 for 100 you get what you pay for. Will not buy these again.
5839,Electronics,4,My 5 year old granddaughter cannot put her Fire tablet down. My granddaughter plays a variety of games and watches videos. She loves her tablet!
5840,Electronics,3,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.
5841,Health & Beauty,1,They didn't work. Took one from each pack and - nothing!
5842,Electronics,4,This is a good tablet for my son to use to play his games.
5843,Health & Beauty,1,Don't buy. Don't last!
5844,Health & Beauty,5,Excellent
5845,Health & Beauty,5,What can I say. There batteries.
5846,Electronics,4,Good for pleasure not for work. But good value for what you pay.
5847,Health & Beauty,4,"These are good basic batteries. Probably not ideal for for things that need a high-performance battey, but for flashlights, remotes they are great and competitively priced."
5848,Electronics,4,"Loved it very good screen quality and clarity, of course its amazon so alot of the regular google play store stuff from androids isnt Available, but they have there own version of stuff that is good also, my kids loved it, i loved it, i highly recommend buying it. But if your hooked on google play id go with a Samsung tablet."
5849,Health & Beauty,3,Batteries don't last very long
5850,Electronics,3,"Zipper on front kept coming apart. Since this opens to the base of the backpack, I almost lost an item. Double check this when you get it give it a few solid tugs"
5851,Health & Beauty,3,GOOD USE
5852,Health & Beauty,4,They do the job.. no issues at all
5853,Health & Beauty,5,Great for the price
5854,Electronics,4,This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
5855,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"Good tablet for kids, only down side is the YouTube for kids app isn't available for the kindle fire"
5856,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this. He can't break it with the thick rubber case, and we can control the games he plays, and how long he plays. Great mix of educational and fun items. The only problem is the charging cord is a bit too easy to break. If they pull it off the charger, it makes the port loose and you have to get the right angle for it to charge."
5857,Health & Beauty,2,Only lasts half as long as the Rayovacs i usually purchase.......
5858,Health & Beauty,4,Another way Amazon makes my life easier!
5859,"Toys & Games,Electronics",3,We purchased this kindle for our 3 yr old since it was lightweight and easy to use. If he would only let one of figure out apps and other functions. So the parental setting are great but havent gotten much further than that
5860,Electronics,4,I bought this device to use with children in my therapy practice. It is taking me awhile to figure out how to set it up and organize it. IT 'took over' and set up things with Amazon I did not approve such as charging my account and registering me with Prime before I could figure out the settings. The picture quality for the screen is beautiful but the camera photos are very pixelated.
5861,Health & Beauty,4,i am impressed
5862,Electronics,3,The layout of the tablet is good. Internet is terrible.
5863,Health & Beauty,4,Good batteries cheap.
5864,Health & Beauty,5,Nice
5865,Health & Beauty,3,Came as expected. Haven't tested life expectancy yet
5866,Electronics,4,"I sent it for my granddaughter as a birthday gift, seemingly she's enjoying and learning thru it."
5867,Health & Beauty,5,I always try to buy Amazon rechargeable batteries. Good price and lasts a long time between charges. Saves a bit of the environment compared to disposable ones.
5868,Electronics,4,This was a great Christmas gift for my kid. This allows them to store their favorite books and play some educational games. Its nice to also have an optional MicroSD card for extra storage.
5869,Electronics,4,It great just a little small then what I would like it have been
5870,Electronics,1,I don‚Äôt care that you can‚Äôt change the tablet to run like as you wish. It‚Äôs pre installed menu is not something you can change.
5871,Electronics,4,"Great product, for a very good price! Loved this tablet"
5872,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,"This has kept my kids entertained, but maybe just a little too entertained. Sadly, they don't want to do much else"
5873,Health & Beauty,5,Good Purchase !
5874,Health & Beauty,1,I came here to look at the one and two star reviews and see that people are saying the same thing I've been thinking since trying to use my first shipment of these batteries which are supposed to be better than the previous version that they replaced. I've used 3 of these batteries so far and each one has barely lasted 2 weeks in my mouse. The previous version usually lasted a couple months at least. It seems like in this day and age it's rare that when things are supposedly improved upon that they're actually better. I can only guess that Amazon found a cheaper supplier for their branded batteries. I guess it's time to cancel my subscribe and save subscription since I'm not the only one who finds these batteries to be subpar to their predecessors. If the rest of the batteries in this pack perform better I'll update my review to reflect that.***Edited to add on 10/12: Now that the 4th battery from this pack lasted just over 2 weeks in my mouse I will be contacting Amazon Customer Service. As I mentioned previously the older version of these batteries worked so well that I have to wonder why they changed them. I see the larger size Amazon batteries still carry the older name.
5875,Electronics,4,Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
5876,Health & Beauty,1,Not good
5877,Health & Beauty,3,They seem to not last as long as other brands. Great Price though
5878,Health & Beauty,2,"I can only use these on those indoor flameless candles and even then, they dont last very long...a little disappointed..."
5879,Health & Beauty,5,Works just as good as the name brands
5880,Electronics,4,The tablet is great with many build in games. The only disadvantage is not a lot of storage.
5881,Health & Beauty,4,Works as intended at a good price.
5882,Electronics,4,Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
5883,Electronics,4,We bought this Fire HD to replace an older model and the kids love it. Ease of use and the integration with Amazon Prime makes the product worth every moment. It is mostly used to watch movies and play some games so it works well for what is needed. Great for the price but if you need more options as far as productivity goes you may want to stick with an iPad or Galaxy Tab.
5884,Electronics,3,"If you're looking for something to keep your laptop cool, this will do the trick. Although only bad things are, it isn't comfortable sitting on your lap as the metal just isn't awesome. The rivets where you rest your hands are welded things and they're uncomfortable as they dig into your hands when trying to type or even resting your hands. Wouldn't recommend.."
5885,Health & Beauty,5,"Good batteries, does as advertised, powers my s***."
5886,Health & Beauty,5,Great way to buy in bulk especially with two gaming boys!
5887,Health & Beauty,1,The batteries linked and ruined my Game Camera. I think you need to replace my game Camera
5888,Health & Beauty,4,"Good quality, seem to last a good long time. Would compare to Energizer or Duracell."
5889,Electronics,4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5890,Electronics,4,Purchased as a replacement for an older kindle and the fire HD did not disappoint. The intended recipient was thrilled that a camera came with it. Well worth the money.
5891,Health & Beauty,4,There batteries. They work
5892,Electronics,4,"I like my Amazon fire-easy to use - user friendly.I liked the size - 8"" . It has made my life much easier since having hand surgery! Easy to check my email and other uses!"
5893,Electronics,4,Picture is great. Quick response when going from site to site. Sound is not so good but what I expected from a tablet.
5894,Electronics,4,Will work well for the purpose it was purchased. My child will love the fun and games that he can play. Very child appropriate and user friendly. I would encourage any parent to buy this product.
5895,Health & Beauty,1,"Utterly worthless, no staying power."
5896,Health & Beauty,4,This my second order and they seem to work as good as name brand and ship to my door.
5897,Health & Beauty,4,good price and they seem to be holding up
5898,Health & Beauty,5,so far so good
5899,Electronics,4,This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
5900,Health & Beauty,5,great deal on batteries
5901,Health & Beauty,4,its ok
5902,Electronics,4,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
5903,Health & Beauty,5,They definitely last at least 7x longer than average batteries
5904,Electronics,4,"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
5905,Health & Beauty,1,Not good. Don't last a week.
5906,Health & Beauty,5,Great value!!
5907,Health & Beauty,5,I Received the Item in a Prompt Time and as Described.
5908,Health & Beauty,4,good
5909,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Best thing I got my kids. They don't ask to borrow mine anymore.
5910,Health & Beauty,4,"They work as expected. Not as long of life as other batteries, but for the price they work well. I just use them for flashlights and remotes and bike lights."
5911,Health & Beauty,5,great as always. thanks
5912,Health & Beauty,5,Love love love.
5913,Electronics,4,My son love's his tablet he uses it for reading and playing games
5914,Electronics,4,Purchased as a a present. Girlfriend loves it. Would suggest buying for yourself or a loved one
5915,Electronics,4,"This is a great tablet for someone who reads a lot, though the battery could use a little upgrading to make it last longer for voracious readers like me. I read A TON so it doesn't last very long. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the purchase and the way the salesperson (can't remember her name) handled everything for me."
5916,Electronics,4,This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
5917,Health & Beauty,5,Good batteries. As good as any major label. Lasts long.
5918,Health & Beauty,5,Great quality and great price.
5919,Electronics,1,My first tablet was a Kindle. I was curious about the updated version. Very disappointed
5920,Electronics,4,We bought this as a gift for someone who travels often. She loves it and said the quality it as expected.
5921,Health & Beauty,5,as expected.
5922,Health & Beauty,5,Another great offer from Amazon that delivers perfarmance and price for your electronic agenda 1
5923,Health & Beauty,5,"Great bargain, long lasting"
5924,Health & Beauty,5,Love love love !
5925,Electronics,4,Perfect for educational games. The protective case sold me.
5926,Electronics,4,My 9 year old loves it. Good control options. Just need to figure out how to get the Web browser on her side.
5927,Electronics,4,"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
5928,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Takes way to long to get a full charge. Other then that works great would be better if it had a better camera on it
5929,Electronics,4,"Easy operation, great product, not a fan of the shiny screen, hard to see in sunlight"
5930,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,"UI is not smooth, it flickers sometimes. Overall a thumbs up from me"
5931,Health & Beauty,5,These are batteries. So far they're working well.
5932,Electronics,4,"Bought this tablet for my kiddos. Pretty good, easy to use"
5933,Health & Beauty,5,"Great price, reliable batteries."
5934,Health & Beauty,1,"Gave these batteries a shot, because we've had great luck with AmazonBasics products. I just purchased the AAA and AA AmazonBasics batteries. These batteries do not last. I have a flashlight that uses 4 AAA batteries, and have gone through 8 batteries in a one week span. These die very quickly. I have had a similar experience with the AA batteries on a wireless Mac keyboard. Would not recommend these batteries."
5935,Electronics,4,"Perfect for development if you use the parental controls properly by setting time limits, goals for reading vs. game play, etc.Durable, reliable, perfect for when you need a few minutes of quiet time. Charger provided was flimsy, but any mini-USB works better."
5936,Health & Beauty,4,So far so good as far as batteries go. I order them under subscribe and save. Makes the price even better and we always have plenty for our toddler.
5937,Electronics,4,"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
5938,Health & Beauty,5,I've had these AA Amazon batteries for a month now and I've had no issues. I replaced the batteries in many of my sons toys when I first got them and all of the toys are still going strong.This pack of batteries comes with 48 AA batteries. It comes in a nice box which I'm still using to keep the unused ones in for storage. I think that the value of these are much better than any other brand. At Walmart for a 24 pack of energizer you will pay 9.94 and for a 24 pack of Duracell you will pay 13.97. This comes with double the amount! With a kid I've learned I can spend a fortune on batteries with all the toys that do not include batteries so I will continue to use these. Very happy with them so far!
5939,Electronics,4,Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
5940,Electronics,4,Updating 3 tablets for my kids from fire 7. Kids love them. Can keep them from fighting in a few seconds
5941,Health & Beauty,5,Good battery
5942,Electronics,4,"I like the tablet; however, there are occasions when it does not boot up when it is turned on. I probably need to take it into the store so that a determination can be made and it can be fixed."
5943,Electronics,4,Happy with the purcase. Gift for my mother in law.
5944,Electronics,4,"It freezes a lot. Lots of problems getting games to cooperate. But overall, my son loves it."
5945,Health & Beauty,4,"These are good batteries, but they don't seem to last as many charges as some other brands I have used. They start to last a shorter time between charges. They were much less expensive than the other batteries so it probably all evens out."
5946,Health & Beauty,5,Cant go wrone with affordable batteries.
5947,Health & Beauty,5,These are just as good as any of the popular brand batteries. My new go to brand.
5948,Health & Beauty,4,for the price these are wonderful!
5949,Health & Beauty,1,i like amazon product.but this battery was not good.
5950,Health & Beauty,5,They work great.
5951,Health & Beauty,5,Better performance than I expected. I feel like I get just as much out of these as the name brands and the price is fantastic. Highly recommend!
5952,Electronics,4,"My daughter loves that it is pink and she enjoys watching videos/playing on the tablet, which is what really matters. Sufficient and cheaper alternative to the more expensive tablet alternatives."
5953,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal
5954,Electronics,4,For the price very good value and its lasting well
5955,Health & Beauty,5,Work great.
5956,Health & Beauty,4,they don't last as long but they're cheap
5957,Electronics,3,"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
5958,Electronics,4,"I bought this for my wife, this is her third Amazon Fire tablet. She mostly uses it for reading but she really likes the speed and the additional features on this one. She's very happy with it"
5959,Health & Beauty,5,These batteries are a no brainer. They work great and the price can't be beat.
5960,Health & Beauty,1,Dead on arrival...please stay away.
5961,Health & Beauty,5,They're batteries. They work well. I use them in motion activated night lights.
5962,Electronics,4,Works well for browsing and reading. It also has great apps.
5963,Health & Beauty,2,Only slightly cheaper than name-brand and far less than half the capacity.
5964,Electronics,3,"Tablet is great. I am trying to get my daughter use to the kindle. We started her at 10 months on an Ipad and thought it would be easier to get one her own tablet now that she is almost 2. Not so, she is struggling to navigate in the kindle. I am not able to transfer her games and movies."
5965,Electronics,4,I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
5966,"Toys & Games,Electronics",4,Great for the kids to play with and easy to monitor their time spent on it and the content they can access.
5967,Health & Beauty,5,"Between LeapPads, Xbox controllers and remotes, we use batteries a lot. These have held up great with a comparable lifespan to other household brands."
5968,Health & Beauty,5,great batteries
5969,Electronics,4,"The amazon fire OS is not a perfect OS but it is very functional and useful for your average tablet use. I would recommend checking the Amazon store to ensure the Apps you are thinking of using on a Fire tablet to ensure you dont have any issues. The size on this one is good, the screen is not the brightest HD screen that is available, but at this price point i cannot complain."
5970,Electronics,4,"my son loves it, is on it all the time, loves all the games. always trying to download all things all the time."
5971,Electronics,4,"I was surprised by the quality of the screen, and it is no slouch either."
5972,Electronics,4,this is a simple machine but enough for me to use for my business
5973,Health & Beauty,5,Great product! Works great!
5974,Health & Beauty,4,Good price for rechargable AAA
5975,Electronics,4,Love this product.. and glad I got it as a gift...
5976,Electronics,4,"It is a nice little no frills tablet, but it could be better, for one it is only limited to amazons web browser, and I like chrome. It is no big deal because what I paid for it I did not expect it to be blazing fast or anything like that."
5977,Electronics,4,It is good product I will till my friend about it good
5978,Electronics,4,"This was purchased to give as a Christmas gift. It's no iPad, of course, but that's not really the idea. It's a strong performer for the money and, in our case, allowed an Amazon Prime member, who didn't have a tablet, to enjoy some entertainment when traveling or hanging around the house for the first time. Made a great gift, he's very pleased."
5979,Health & Beauty,5,they seem to work as well as any other battery I've tried.
5980,Health & Beauty,5,tested these batteries along side name brand in a handheld microphone and they actually preformed better and lasted longer then the big name brands.
5981,Health & Beauty,5,Good value
5982,Health & Beauty,5,Good buy on good batteries
5983,Health & Beauty,5,Its a battery and it works
5984,Electronics,3,"A good starter tablet, but very very slow. Don't expect and I Pad savy child to enjoy this. But for a true beginner it would be fine."
5985,Electronics,4,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5986,Electronics,3,"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
5987,Electronics,4,"I grabbed this when it was on sale for Black Friday because it was such a good price. I had a regular Kindle before & traded it in to Amazon with the intention of getting another regular Kindle but I never did. In the meantime I did get an iPad Pro & I thought that would function as my Kindle/e-reader. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my iPad. But the iPad Pro is just way too big to comfortably read in bed (12.9‚Äù) or carry around in my bag to have with me when I expect to be in a waiting room somewhere & might want a book or magazine. It‚Äôs also too big (and too expensive) to bring to the gym to set on the treadmill to watch a TV show while I workout. So I grabbed this Kindle hoping it would be everything my iPad is not. So far it does everything I need it to do. It was easy to set up right out of the box. I easily synced it with my Amazon account so I could pull my books, music, movies, & TV shows right from my Amazon account right away. I did add the Netflix and Hulu apps so I could watch some shows while I worked out. The screen is great. The picture is crisp and clear & way better than I expected. The sound is fantastic. It is easy to read on (which should be no surprise since that it was Kindles are made to do). I like that it integrates so easily with my Goodreads account. I haven‚Äôt spent much time browsing the web on it since that‚Äôs not what I bought it for. So I can‚Äôt speak to how it functions as a traditional tablet. But as an e-reader and media player, it is fantastic. I have had some issues with the SD card alerting me that it has been removed when it wasn‚Äôt, but some research showed me that it is not an uncommon issue with these Kindles & I‚Äôm hopeful that it will be resolved soon. Overall this is a great little tablet. It‚Äôs small & lightweight enough to just throw in my bag & have with me wherever I go. The size is perfect to read a book, but also a great size to watch a movie on when you‚Äôre on the go. It also feels pretty sturdy. I did buy a case for it, but I feel like it‚Äôs pretty solid on its own."
5988,Health & Beauty,5,Great deal. They work just as well as any other familiar name brand battery. Long life.
5989,Health & Beauty,5,Damn that's a lot of batteries!
5990,Health & Beauty,5,It was so convenient to purchase the batteries along with the device I bought for Christmas that needed the battery. It shipped right along with the gift.
5991,Health & Beauty,1,"DO NOT PURCHASE! These batteries leaked in a machine I was using in my kids room to project stars on the ceiling. When I picked the projector up, it leaked battery fluid on me and burned my arms and legs. It could have gotten on my children! The leaking fluid also ruined the projector.The batteries were new, stored at room temp, used at room temp, not recharged, and not exposed to any fluid or abnormal conditions. Disposing in the appropriate manner.ETA: I was VERY happy with Amazon's resolution despite this bad experience. Thanks Amazon... I'll order batteries from you again. Just not your brand..."
5992,Health & Beauty,4,"They're batteries, and they're alkaline and they work very well."
5993,Electronics,4,I love this little speaker. It is small enough to carry it wherever I want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard The Alexa interface is pretty cool as well. The only issue for me is that it doesn't connect with Apple Music. This issue is easily resolved by putting Tap in Bluetooth mode and playing Apple Music through my phone to the Tap
5994,Health & Beauty,1,"Went to pit them on for the first time and the strap behind the buckle broke. Never even got to wear them. Poor construction, cheaply made product."
5995,Electronics,4,Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
5996,Electronics,4,I thought it would be good for my 2year old he does awesome on a iPad but could not get the hang of the kindle fire
5997,Health & Beauty,1,Wrong Item
5998,"Electronics,Media",4,"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle."
5999,"Office Supplies,Electronics",4,Nice alternative for reading kindle books for kids. Not many features but good enough for reading.
